1hlrl7m,1735092231.0,"TripAdvisor honored $14,000 mistake.",iam10eight,"
Not so much a “hack” as it was an error made by TripAdvisor that they honored and I believe is worth a share. 

Earlier in the year I was planning a vacation for my family in Asia. I used TA to look for hotels and to look at their prices, rating, and read reviews. 

During my search, I found the Four Seasons and saw the price was jokingly and mistakenly listed way too low. They had their 2 bedroom villa with a private pool listed at under $200/ni. I KNOW this resort and know it goes for 10x that price. I immediately went to Four Seasons website and all other third party accommodation companies and sure enough, that resort for that villa was listed at a little under $3000/ni. 

I decided to book through TA for 5 nights for shits and giggles and paid the amount for my stay and even got the confirmation email from TA confirming my stay. 

A week later I reached out to Four Seasons who said they couldn’t find my booking; I knew this was likely too good to be true. I reached out to TA who confirmed they made a “mapping” mistake on their site and that price listed was supposed to be for a different resort. 

I went back and forth with TA for a bit and they said they will try their best to fix the issue. About a week later I got an email from TA confirming that they will honor their mistake and confirmed me with the Four Seasons. I reached out to FS who now sees my booking and confirmed me. 

Come vacation time, I checked in flawlessly and checked out without any surprises. The stay was amazing with the service and experience one expects from the Four Seasons, which I was able to get at over 90% off. 

During this ordeal, I honestly was laughing with my wife telling her we should look for another resort as there was no way TA was going to honor this, yet they did. So just wanted to give TA their rightful shoutout and share this story of a successful TA booking story. ",159,10816,TravelHacks
1hsik2h,1735895895.0,Please do this if you check in your bag on a flight ,McVeggy,"As a baggage officer, I strongly recommend attaching a sturdy personal identification tag to your checked
luggage, in addition to the airline's tag. 
Baggage tags can sometimes become detached during transit, especially if a bag gets caught on the conveyor system. 
While we're usually able to reunite passengers with their bags even if the airline tag is missing, a small percentage remain unclaimed. 
A simple tag with your name and phone number (please add the country code) inside or outside the bag significantly increases the chances of us getting your bag back to you quickly, especially if you have a common suitcase like a generic black bag",234,3194,TravelHacks

1iuqz4w,1740144773.0,Can I sleep in the LAX airport for 3-4 days?,Iscejas,"So my best friend just died and he lived in another state. I need to go be with his family to support them and help them with the end of life stuff. This was an emergency flight and i could not save any money because this was unexpected. I am a college student with no job (technically I just stared my new job but don’t get paid in a while) so I cannot afford a hotel. I am planning to sleep in the LAX airport for 3-4 nights before returning to my hometown. What are the chances of being noticed? 

Update: I forgot hostels existed so I am going to stay in one. I have also cut the trip down to one overnight so it’s cheap, I will not stay for 4 days. Thank you so much. 

Update 2: my university allows you to take money out of your student account and convert it back to cash. I will do that to get additional money. If I need any additional money, I can ask to borrow money (obviously not from my friends family but from another person who is also coming to support them) 

Update 3: I figured it all out. I just bought plane tickets via credit card to arrive the day before the viewing and depart later that night. The 1 night hotel stay will be covered by my friend’s family (I’ll pay them back over time). Transportation will be through friends family. I’ll try to bring food from home so I don’t have to pay for it, I’m sure I could bring enough to last a day and a half.

1j8dbck,1741650759.0,"If renting a car, don’t stray from the gas vehicles.",keltzyy,"I flew into Austin, TX this past Thursday and paid $400 dollars for an electric rental for a week. It was supposed to get a Tesla but ended up with a 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5.

It is now Monday.

So far, I have spent $140.00 on charging this car. Each time not being under 45% battery remaining. I have drove 500-515 miles so far, with going to visiting family and what not. 

Currently, I’m sitting at a charging station for an hour to get back up to 100% so I don’t have to touch this thing again until I fly back out Wednesday. I’ve had most charges run about $25 dollar. On my way home today, I was charged SIXY SEVEN DOLLARS to use the one at Hyundai car dealership (the literal maker of this vehicle)

Back home, I have a RAV4 that gets 350ish miles to a full tank that cost me about $35-$40 to fill up. So I would be looking at about $80 max in gas in a normal vehicle. 

I have spent so much money and time on this car just getting to point A to point B that I tried calling to trade in for the last day and a half for a gas car and they want to charge me 100 to do so. (Budget Car Rental)

TLDR: don’t get the electric rental, it’s a gas guzzler. 

Edit: 
I put my phone down and didn’t come check on this for a while so let me say a couple things I’m seeing in repeat. 

1. “You just didn’t do your research”: I have rented teslas on three different occasions. This was supposed to be my fourth. I got to the counter and they didn’t have a Tesla for me. Terribly sorry I didn’t think there would be too much a difference.

2. I am not in any way saying EV cars are bad. They are great if you have a way to charge them at your house when you own them. Renting is just not smart, which I have learned the hard way. ",477,1653,TravelHacks

I would love to have a list of other peoples small tricks as well, so please share your top learnings over the years. Here are 2 of mine to start the list of:

\- If you bring your own water bottle to the plane, you can also ask the flight attendants to fill it up for you. This allows you to get a lot more water than just the small cups they hand out when they walk past you in the aisle. I find this very useful on long flights where you dehydrate quickly. Walking to the back of the plan with your empty bottle seems to work best and they pretty much always fill it up completely with water

\- If you want to sleep on your flight during  overnight  travel, booking a low cost airline that does not serve any food or drinks is actually much better than the higher priced airlines that do. Serving first drinks, then food and then picking up the trash again causes a lot of noise and movement in the plane. And this also causes the other guests to use the restroom much more frequent, therefore creating a much worse environment to sleep on a flight. Therefore if I want to sleep I book a carrier that I know does not serve anything and just eat something at the terminal or airport lounge before takeoff. Then the moment I sit down in my seat, I just put my  sleeping mask on and focus on having a restful trip, not worrying about any food/drinks.",794,1244,TravelHacks

1hgpf67,1734482283.0,To those who say airlines don't track cookies ,sunnynihilist,"They DO!!!

I found an open-jaw ticket from June to August with Thai Airways for about 710 euro. Departing Brussels --> Hong Kong, then Kuala Lumpur --> Brussels.

I wanted to book the flight before going to bed on the same day I found it (a Tuesday! LOL). Guess what, it jumped to 766 euro. I was furious.

The next day, the same flights didn't even show up on Google Flights. I was in panic mode. Only the crappy flights of over 800 euros with long layovers were shown to me.

Out of desperation, I cleared all the cookies on my mobile and laptop and set my VPN to Mexico, and used the incognito browser as usual. The fare I wanted was available AGAIN! I couldn't believe my eyes.

I first wanted to buy the ticket on my phone but it didn't work, so I moved on to the laptop with no VPN installed. The good fare can still be found.

I instantly bought the tickets and now it feels so good to have a peace of mind. I can finally focus on planning my itinerary.

So, clear your cookies before booking flights!",147,1047,TravelHacks
152abl0,1689619614.0,American Airlines barred a 17-year-old from flying with the airline for 3 years because he tried to use a 'skiplagging' ticket,Loves_LV,"[Link to article](https://www.insider.com/skiplagging-american-airlines-banned-teenager-hidden-city-ticket-canceled-2023-7?utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=topbar)

Skiplagging, the hack that maybe isn't. 

I was curious on how he got caught. Teen's hidden city was Charlotte, NC. Turns out he went to the counter to check-in for his flight and upon seeing his NC driver's license the check-in agent got suspicious (likely because they know the pricing on that route was susceptible to skiplagging) and he was pulled aside for questioning. 

His father's explanation is a bit weird too. 

Remember the unspoken rules for these kinds of tickets. Avoid all interaction with airline staff and check-in online. Any interaction is an opportunity for them to figure out you're skiplagging. Never check luggage or travel with anything larger an item that fits under the seat in front of you. You risk being forced to gate check a bag. Never use your frequent flier account as this could get you banned and lose all your points. Also, they recommend using different credit cards so they can't tie multiple trips back to the same person. This also means if you have TSA pre you can't use that because it will link the reservations to one person. 

Personally, I've never skiplagged and probably won't the risk is too high. I have booked itineraries on separate itineraries when booking on a single itinerary is way more expensive. There's risk involved with this too but it's usually a calculated risk and it's also not against an airlines contract of carriage. Usually the final leg is cheap on it's own and even if I have to buy a last minute ticket it will still save money compared to buying them together.",444,971,TravelHacks

14or8j1,1688312153.0,"Please get travel insurance, it helps more than you know",DVIGRVT,"I'm writing this as I am approaching a very important anniversary in my life

7 years ago, my husband and I were off to Seattle to venture on a family cruise. My parents,  sister and BIL were all going to meet up on embarkation day but my husband and i decided to visit Seattle a couple of days earlier

We got to Seattle and had dinner and went to bed. The next morning, we intended to take on the Space Needle. We never made it. 

My husband collapsed in our AirBnB. With some fast thinking i called 911 and stated CPR at the dispatchers urgence. I had no idea what i was doing but the EMT got there within minutes. Come to find out my husband had a massive heart attack and was defibbed twice in the field before they got a pulse and got him in the ambulance. 

An emergency cath lab experience and 3 stents later, his first day of emergency care was billed to our insurance company at over $250K. He spent 5 days in ICU and 3 more in step- down. Now here's where the insurance kicked in. 

My mom called the insurance company immediately to tell them what happened. They immediately cancelled our cruise for me,  my husband and my parents without question. We all insisted my sister and BIL still go, so they did. 

Their medical team reached out to me. They were so helpful in navigating everything for me while my husband was intubated and unconscious and in critical condition. They coordinated care with the hospital to ensure my husband's care was well taken care of. They reviewed the hospital's records daily on my husband's treatment (with my consent) and consumed with the doctors to make sure nothing was missed. They called me every day to check in, see how i was doing and get updates about my husband. When my husband finally woke up, extubated, and recovering and went to step- down, the insurance medical team coordinated his upcoming discharge plans. They told me they would arrange an RN with oxygen if it was needed (thank goodness it wasn't) and a wheelchair escort upon getting to the airport on our way home. When we left the hospital and went to a hotel for a couple of days before returning home, the medical team continued to check in. Never did they abandon me. That comfort alone was with more than the cost of the insurance alone. 

Once we got home and the medical bills began to roll in, with each payment we made, receipts were turned in and the insurance reimbursed us every last penny without question or hassle. 

The point is, for a small percentage of your trip, the insurance is priceless on so many levels of G-d forbid you need it. Hopefully you'll never experience the hell we went through, but 7 years later my husband is in better shape now than he had been in 25 years.

It's really frustrating to get to a hotel and find that they have a local fee on top of the price you booked. I am so sick of everything, whether tipping, ticketmaster fees, or hotels.... charging extra fees and hiding how much the actual cost is.

why is this happening?

EDIT: I will add that google and a few of the major booking services could easily end this by just verifying prices and including the total in their aggregate price they show when you search. it wouldnt be hard to fix. but i hate looking for a hotel on google, finding one, and then going to the final page where i pay, trying to add up all the bullshit and see that the price is actually double what they advertised it as. like WTF",229,642,TravelHacks
1ehc280,1722503212.0,Long layover hack,Feedingfrenzy91,"The hack is pretty simple. If you find yourself with maybe 6 or more hours in an airport instead of looking for places to eat check what prices the lounges in the airport are for a day pass. Sometimes you would actually spend less than you would on food that day.

Example: Recently me and 2 others found ourselves with about 11 hours in Miami airport. Before we went to any restaurant I checked out the lounges and by the grace of God found one that's day pass was only $48 (which we probably would have spent more on food that day at the airport as we ate breakfast, lunch and dinner in the lounge).

1hvt1ws,1736261402.0,Sharing three flight booking tips that I don't see mentioned so often.,airglitch_,"Hi! I feel flight booking tips often revolve around flexibility. Flying on Tuesdays or on Christmas Eve might be cheaper, but it's quite inconvenient.

Instead, I am sharing three strategies I use to make high-demand / expensive flights a little more affordable. It won't get you the absolute cheapest fare, but can help bring a $1300 super convenient direct flight to, e.g. $800.

**1. Spare multicity**  
You all know about hidden-city flights. It's a bit the same idea but without the inconvenience. Instead of exiting at the layover, you only fly a portion of an open-jaw itinerary.

One way ($500)  
LAX -> ORD (May 4) | Flown

Open-jaw ($300)  
LAX -> ORD (May 4) | Flown  
ORD -> JFK (May 16) | Dropped

Note that here ORD is not a connection, but a destination with departure on another journey. So you can check a bag and don't have to worry about your flight being rerouted in case of delay / cancellation. Also, the risk of being penalised by the airline is pretty low. You're not dropping a segment, simply having a no-show on another journey you won't even check in for. In that sense, it's very similar to a Throwaway Return ticket, but running the search with a different destination can sometimes yields better savings.

**2. Long layover**  
It's a pretty common way for flexible travelers to save on flights: turn a terribly long layover into an extra city stop and enjoy it instead. But you can also use it on a predefined itinerary. Say you have a 2-day stop in a city as part of a trip with several destinations, your first instinct might be look use multicity search or separate tickets. Instead, use ITA Matrix to filter for a long stop where you need to be, it might turn up cheaper. If the flight is not available online, try calling the airline to book it.

**3. Nested trips**  
You might know about back-to-back ticketing. When instead of booking two similar roundtrips sequentially, you nest them into each other:

Sequential

|Tickets|Trip 1.1|Trip 1.2|Trip 2.1|Trip 2.2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$500|A → B|B → A|||
|$500|||A → B|B → A|

Back-to-back

|Tickets|Trip 1.1|Trip 1.2|Trip 2.1|Trip 2.2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$250|A → B|||B → A|
|$300||B → A|A → B||

Using open-jaw tickets, you can also achieve that with two trips that have different destinations, e.g.:

|Tickets|Trip 1.1|Trip 1.2|Trip 2.1|Trip 2.2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Open-jaw #1|Paris → LA|||Denver → Paris|
|Open-jaw #2||LA → Paris|Paris → Denver||

It's not guaranteed to be cheaper, but it can help you reach minimum stay requirements that open access to lower fare classes.

These aren't magical solutions, but running these extra checks every time I book flights got me a good amount of savings over time!

EDIT: number #3 confused a bit people, so adding two elements:  
\- from u/SCDWS (thank you!): ""It's like booking a return trip and skipping the return flight, except instead of a return trip, it's a multi-city trip with a different final destination""  
\- you can call the airline to cancel the flight you don't need instead of a no-show (e.g. say you have a medical issue) - you might be able to get a refund for part of the cost (e.g. the airport fees).

pkfq89,1631124088.0,AirBNB now allows hosts to severely misrepresent map locations so research the listing titles very carefully. My $1100 booking was in an entirely different city 50 miles away and AirBNB refused to step in other than to encourage the host to refund. Two tense days later she finally decided to do so.,kiarga,"Being unfamiliar with the way my destination city looked, and the names of the neighborhoods, I assumed my listing would be within the bubble of possibility, which encompassed a few dozen blocks in the city center right where I wanted to be.

The actual address was only revealed after I'd paid. Sonsonate wasn't the name of the neighborhood, but referred to the city of Sonsonate 50 miles to the west. Thinking this was just a website error I shared a screenshot of the incorrect map with the host and asked for a refund. The host replied ""sorry but the listing title was correct"", so I contacted customer service.

Support responded the next day saying there was no violation of policy, so I would only be entitled to a refund of the $50 cleaning fee unless the host voluntarily refunded! They would try to negotiate on my behalf but could not force the host.

The host did refund the money after a rather long holdout, then a few days later I resumed searching the same area for lodging and again saw the same listing showing up in the city center, a hole for others to fall down and waste days of their time. Thinking the customer service agent that ""helped"" me may have been confused, I clicked ""report listing"" and shared my story along with screenshots. A different AirBNB support team member then responded:

# Pre Booking

* Fly between the largest possible hub airports, more airlines competing == lower fares. Taking a train 3-6 hour once you arrive for $20 is better than a more ‘convenient’ flight for $200 more. This site shows what connected airports are biggest: [https://www.flightconnections.com/](https://www.flightconnections.com/)
* Let flight deals dictate your travel plans, flights are often the most expensive aspect. You  could save over $1k if you travel based on deals instead of wanting to go to specific place at a specific time
* Look at flights way ahead of time but when you’re planning to book, as you do, flights get ‘hotter’, try and wait a day after you concluded your search so prices ‘cool down’
* Use a cheap old android phone in incognito mode to search flights and prices. Searching on a high end MacBook sometimes gets you higher fares, especially when booking directly with airlines
* Statistically the cheapest time to book is 64 days before desired departure
* Don't bring a checked bag for ultimate savings and airport convenience. Also, no lost bag
* Churn a credit card to save $500+ on a flight with travel points. Many credit cards offer a 1 year sign up for free, bonus signup points and include travel insurance
* If flying 10+ hours, deliberately choose a flight with the longest layover possible, bonus if you'd arrive in the stopover country late in the afternoon. You'll be able to get a much better sleep in a hotel in the stopover country, in addition to saving bucket loads on the flight. You can also leverage stopover to ’tick off’ other countries/places you'd otherwise not visit
* Some excellent dates to fly out is on Christmas or New year's days early in the morning. Bonus, try to fly to countries that don't celebrate the same holidays as yours so you get a holiday aligned with your work break but you don't pay through the nose on the place you're going. E.g do easter in China, or Australia Day in New Zealand
* Try to travel when your local state has public holidays, this reduces the leave you need to take. My favourite time is between Easter and Australian Anzac Day because a lot of countries don't have days off for then so they often aren't more expensive AND it's not school holidays, but you also get 3 free days of leave
* December is always expensive to fly. Try to either depart on one of the last days of November or return on one of the first days of January
* If you get all the way through the flight booking process and it tells you prices have increased so “go back and start again”. Give it at least 24 hours before retrying. Sometimes even a week if you can be patient, let prices ‘cool down’
* A lot of marketplaces have people selling flight vouchers and credits, often if you're planning to book at the same time you find a seller and you tell them you'll book immediately they'll discount you more (upto and beyond 30%) where you can also validate the credit works along side them.
* Always check the weather for the month in the place you're planning to book. E.g A tropical island in monsoon season is often worse than not going at all. My biggest tip is travel to places when they're experiencing their best weather
* Find good flights on third party sites, note the dates and airline, wait a day then use the airlines site directly. It's often a few dozen dollars cheaper
* If you're searching for flights on the month “view”, often when you click a departure date you'll see a lot return dates that aren't populated eg ?With only a few good ones, this is to incentivise you to book a specific period that's best for the airline. To take advantage, pick some departure dates close to when you'd like to return and notice the best return flights that actually load. Now pick a better earlier departure date, if the return day you want has changed to a ?If you click it anyway and search, you'll find it's the same price.
* If travelling with one other person and you feel like getting a row to yourselves. Book the window and the aisle, the single ‘’between” seats are last to get filled. If someone does take it, it's usually easy to swap them for the window or aisle, if not then one of you gets the floor and the other gets the row of seats, have a nice sleep!
* If you want to visit multiple countries in one big trip, book a return from home to country A, then another return from country A to country B ($). This will save about 30% rather than doing home > A > B > home ($$$). Also you'll get to “taste test” country A. Better still, book home > country A city A, then travel to country A city B and do a return to country B ($$)
* The far right seat at the back center of the plane where it decreases from 4 to 3 has the most space and doesn't cost much extra. You can put your leg way out and it wont get bumped by passers by or the trolley

# Flights

* Ensure you're the last on the flight and then go into the bathroom, wait until they tell you to get out and pick whatever seat you want on the plane - everyone should be seated by then
* Wear a pride wrist band on each sleeve to potentially get both arm rests on the flight, works when seated next to men
* Laptops are heavy, when checking in, put it inside the back of your pants under your shirt. Once your bags have been weighed, put it back in your bag. This also works if they weigh at the boarding gate
* Bring an empty water bottle, most airports have filling fountains
* Wear your heaviest clothes on you on the plane, you aren’t weighed
* Airport Chappell's are the quietest place to be, good for a sleep
* Never exchange cash at an airport FX converter. The best place is a bank, second best is an ATM. With ATMs, always decline it to do the fx conversion, your bank will do it for you at a better rate automatically
* If you want to bring a second carry on bag, bring one that's a modest size. At the duty free area, buy the cheapest thing you can like a pack of tim tams and then ask for a duty free bag. Put your second carry on inside it. Most airlines allow a bonus duty free bag in addition to one carry on
* Put a napkin between your phone and your phone case sticking out on one side, put that side in the tray table locking mechanism with the tray up for a simple phone holder
* Alternatively, Use a selfie stick to hold your phone for movies on a flight in a much higher and more ergonomic position, allowing you to better lean back, saving your neck
* Don't watch shows with short episodes or play games with short arcady levels. You'll check the clock everytime you finish one and it'll make time drag on. Watch long movies, play endless games or my favorite: be productive on something that gets you ‘’in the zone” like coding, reading or writing

# Hotels

* Get a hotel with an included buffet, eat like crazy and take as much food away as possible. Also, do this as late into the breakfast period as you can to feel full for as much of the day as you can - don't do this at little hotels, only chains for ethical reasons
* Random hotel lobbies have the cleanest bathrooms - Just act like you booked a room
* Get an inflatable ergonomic pillow, you'll never have neck pain from bad hotel/hostels pillows. Tip: Only inflate it about half way for best softness
* Don't get a universal charger. If you don't travel a lot you'll lose it or lose an important piece of it. I think it's best to get a singular adapter designed for the destination countries plug for each trip and just keep a collection. They are simpler, lighter and often more reliable
* If you have to cancel a hotel reservation but it's not free anymore, ask to rebook it later. Then cancel
* Confirm stay and arrivals times with hotels a few days beforehand, it prevents your room being overbooked and you being stranded. Further, be really nice and ask if you could get a free upgrade

# Backpacking

* Bring two phones. I like to film/take photos with my nicer phone but doing so drains the battery a lot, this leads me to bring a battery bank and cables which is a pain. A second (usually old or cheap) phone can be what you use for maps, texting, travel sim and itinerary so you'll often end the day with both phones on 50% charge. Bonus tip, bring a tiny 10cm USB C-C cable and both phones can charge each other so you don't need a battery bank at all
* Get a passport travel wallet that opens with the fold on the shorter side so you can fit notes and boarding passes without needing to fold them up awkwardly
* Instead of a thick raincoat, bring a ‘’single use’ poncho. You can totally use these dozens of times on a single trip
* If you wear sandals, you don't need to pack any socks
* Merrino wool shirts only need to be washed every 4 days max if you're heavily sweating, less if you’re not. They also dry super fast after a rinse in the sink with soapy water. You could easily do a 2 week trip with 3 shirts and only washing one once
* Add mini carabiners to any loops on the outside of your bag, then you can attach anything that itself has a loop so you don't need to carry it
* Get a foldable water bottle, as it empties it takes up less space. Get a good one otherwise the water will taste awful
* Get a 65w + GaN charger - They’re tiny but a little expensive
* Bring a lightweight thin bag with drawer strings for dirty washing. Keep it seperate from your clean clothes, it’ll take almost no space when empty and they’re less noisy than plastic bags which hostels bunmates will be thankful for
* NoDoz is a capsule caffeine tablet that gives great energy and will dramatically improve your mood when you're tired
* Ear buds take up a lot less space than headphones on a flight and the noise cancelling is usually ‘good enough’
* Work remotely 3 days a week while travelling if you’re allowed. You'll appreciate those 3 “rest days” and become more attuned to the area you’re staying while also planning your busier days closer to when you'll actually do them. You also retain 3/5ths of an income and only use up 2/5th of your annual leave
* If staying in a hostel, cook for everyone! It's fun to get some randoms together to go ingredient shopping, especially if none of you know the language, it becomes a real mission. Then while cooking people will be stoked to socialise with you, they'll be grateful and often return the favour
* Taking photos or videos on a phone that automatically backs up with google photos or iCloud is way better than needing to offload an SD card and manually do it yourself every day off of a camera. Also your phone adds metadata that makes searching for moments easier. Bonus, you can make albums for specific people and after a trip, send it to them so they have all their photos of themselves from you in one place

## Misc.

* If you're planning to take a ride share app to/from the airport. Check it regularly before you actually need to go and track the prices. Likely you'll see it double and halve as demand grows and shrinks. Work out what “cheap” is and once you see it, tap “schedule in advance” for a time you’ll be ready to go
* Keep a digital copy of all your documents, tickets, passport, visas, hotels on your phone in a locally saved folder
* Always have an airtag in each bag you're travelling with
* Download maps of the areas you'll travel in advance. So that even if you don't have a Sim you still get GPS, also sometimes the downloaded map will have a detailed floorpan of the airport
* Download the local language on google translate in advance too
* Hydralyte tablets and gastro stop will make short work of any food poisoning
* Bring some basic colored string to braid friendahip bracelets for people you meet
* If travelling in less developed countries, the biggest source of illness is bad water. Don't consume ice, sliced fruit or meat. Opt for vegan food in hot boiling wateror steamed and or go for reputable chains to avoid getting sick. Sneaky tip, eat places where you see kids and crows lined up, parents usually put a lot of work into ensuring their kids won't get sick so they’ve done the work for you.

Edit: Lot's of very fair criticism for a few of these, naturally with such a long list that has been curated over years, some may seem obvious, others may seems offensive.

To address them:

\- Do not hold up the plane waiting in the bathroom, I still recomend trying to be one of the last one's to board though, if only to spend less time cramped on the plane. This is less ideal if you need an overhead baggage stowed but if you only have one bag then you should be fine and if the plane is kinda empty, you could still get a better seat, just make sure it's free, ideally wait until takeoff like most people do

\- Booking with an old phone probably won't get you cheaper flights. To me it always \*felt\* like it did, but it's unlikely

\- Don't wear pride bracelets if you don't support the movement or soley to make others uncomfortable. I'm ace and a strong supporter, when wearing them while flying out of Thailand I discovered this 'hack' that got some rude old gentlemen to throw a fit. Regardless, showing pride is also a great conversation starter and a nice way to make friends, so I still recommend it

\- Weather! Yes it seems obvious to travel in 'good weather' but when you discover an outstanding deal it may slip your mind and you don't realise it's monsoon or heatwave season, so always good to check. Others recommend travelling on the 'shoulder' season if you can, which I highly recommend

Overall I'm really glad you guys like the adhoc list I've built over time, it's something I'll keep building as I travel. Thanks for all the support!

yrcspk,1668081616.0,Don't eat pre-cut fruit,xXCosmicChaosXx,"*Edit* 

Here's some collective general food poisoning advice:

As people have said, if you can't peel it, cook it or boil it then forget it. Food should be hot and fresh. Same advice as in this post also applies to uncooked salads / pre cut veggies / washed veggies (unless you can confirm they've been washed and grown in clean water). Also important is to only drink filtered or bottled water, avoid ice and only brush teeth with filtered water too. Good advice to go to a place with some turnover and don't order something which may have been stored for a long time and not frequently ordered and also uncooked (E.g. a burger bun at an Indian restaurant in a non tourist area, got food poisoning from that in 2020 believe it or not). Meat also carries it's own unique risks, but as I'm a vegetarian you'll have to do your own research on that one. Take probiotics and stock a bunch of stuff that can help control indigestion too (e.g. peppermint oil caps, calcium carbonate, buscopan, pepto etc). Watch out for unpasteurized milk. Carry hand sanitizer. Get travel insurance and have extra money to front immediate costs. Get your travel vaccinations. 

And last but not least... don't be scared or put off by all of this! You should still be cautious and follow some guidelines, but follow this advice and you should be sweet! So jump in and get traveling food poisoning FREE.

*Original story* 

I can't believe I made such a rookie mistake. In Bangalore, India I bought a bowl of pre cut fruit (papaya, watermelon, banana) from a street stall. I assumed it had just been cut recently and it was fine. It also wasn't refrigerated but it looked totally fresh. I got some SERIOUS food poisoning that day. I wrongly assumed that it was from a curry that I ate that same day, so 5 days later I got some from a different stall and got food poisoning again...

After researching I discovered that pre cut fruit is something you should avoid, especially in developing countries. The rind or peel protects the inside of the fruit or vegetable from bacteria. As soon as you cut it it's shelf life goes way down too. Pre cut fruit is often handled with no gloves and also not cooked so any bacteria can grow on it easily. It's also often out in the open so bacteria can build up over time, and often it is washed in local tap water. So if you want to eat fruit while you're traveling you should just buy something you can peel yourself.",81,392,TravelHacks

10kpc0l,1674618740.0,10 More best travel tips not on that list of 50,UWarchaeologist,"To add to the list:

1. Vacuum compression bags for clothes. Once you use them, you'll wonder how you travelled without them.
2. For long flights and long days where you maybe sleep on a train overnight and don't get to change clothes, and more especially underwear, bring some very light panty liners.  Swapping them out is like having a fresh pair of underwear.
3. Visiting high-impact tourism cities in high season (Venice, Rome, Florence, Istanbul)? Don't be the cool adventurer traveler who wouldn't be caught dead in an organized tour or cruise. Being part of a pre-arranged tour or cruise is what allows you to skip that 3-hour line into the Vatican or Topkapi palace and actually see the stuff you came to see.
4. You don't need that restaurant meal, at least not more than once a day. Buy a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese and some apples or whatever is the local snack.
5. Put the camera away. It's liberating to enjoy travel without feeling that it didn't happen without a selfie and a social media post.
6. Scan your passport, itinerary, contact information, drivers license, bank phone numbers etc and put it all on a google drive that is shared with family or a trusted contact back home. If you lose everything, it's incredibly useful to have.
7. For more adventurous travel, a quart bag medical kit should have cold and flu symptom relief pills, motion sickness treatment, bandage tape (anything can be a bandage, so you just need the tape), pain killers, zinc and vitamin C tabs, antihistamine, anti diarrheal medicine, UTI treatment if you're prone to UTI's, location specific meds eg for malaria, and a broad spectrum antibiotic that you educate yourself on the appropriate time and way to use).
8. Travelling alone is awesome. Bring a few small representative gifts or items from your own country to give to people who befriend and/or help you on your travels.
9. Love a cup of tea or coffee or just want to boil water? You can get small portable folding compact kettles to boil water from any electrical outlet and have that cuppa anytime.
10. If you are spending more than a few hours in any city, master the public transport system and use it to get around.",111,382,TravelHacks

143rl24,1686177954.0,I spent 110 hours developing a Chrome extension that displays the hotel’s website direct price while browsing Booking,thepuggo,"As you all know, fellow travelers, the best trick to save on hotels is booking directly on the hotel website, rather than relying on intermediaries such as Booking.com.

That’s why my hotel search journey looks like this: searching on Booking, choosing a hotel, Googling the hotel’s official website checking whether the direct price for my dates is cheaper than the one offered in Booking, which, quite frequently, turns out to be the case (and sometimes by a significant margin).

So, just for fun and after many hours of trial and error, I finally managed to automate that process in a Chrome extension I called vsHotel (pronounced “versus hotel”) that [you can download for free here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vshotel/njnakjakcnkmnogiopbiomdleekeogkp/)

How it works: just install it, browse Booking.com as usual, and when on a hotel page (important, it doesn’t work in the search results) the extension will attempt to gather the price for your selected dates on the hotel’s official website and provide you with the price and a link to book your stay directly.

Developing this was tricky, since almost every hotel website has its own booking engine with a different interface, so it was impossible to code a scraper for all of them.

The workaround was searching these specific dates on Google Travel and extracting the price, which works great (as long as the hotel is on Google Travel, around 80% of them are).

It is worth noting that the prices shown in Google Travel (and therefore in vsHotel) are not always up to date, so it doesn't hurt to manually check by clicking on the website link.

Any feedback will be appreciated!",32,373,TravelHacks

Assuming 5-10% commissions and the fact that I’m planning 1 destination with transfers with a couple of day excursions over 9 days with a budget of 800-1000 a day I assume they’d make 500-1000 for a few phone calls or web bookings through their standard outlets, right? . *I* can probably book the trip with a couple of phone calls or phone apps but want a pro to do it because I don’t have the experience in that part of the world.

1j9nrhp,1741796116.0,Buy the ticket when the price is decent,StumblinThroughLife,"This is more of an anti-hack, don’t do what I did. The flight to visit my family is usually $400-600 (which sucks). Saw a ticket for $424 and instead of buying, procrastinated. It could hit the 300s maybe right? I’ll wait. 

Went to check a week later and it was now $746. Still had to confirm the dates worked for them at this point so still didn’t buy. Checked the next day and it became $912 for a 3 hr nonstop flight 🙃. Was 2 seconds from calling my parents that I wasn’t coming to visit anymore. By some miracle just as I was about to call, I saw if I moved my dates over 2 days it would go back down to $640. All the dates around it were minimally $850 still. Booked that immediately. And let’s go back to the procrastination part, I bought this ticket yesterday for a flight this Thursday, now moved to Saturday😬. 

So please everyone don’t do what I did. When you know the price range of a place you go often, just buy it when it’s decent. Don’t wait for some imaginary deal that’s not coming. 

Side note: I only ever use incognito browsers and different sites up until the moment I buy so they don’t use my cache to inflate the prices. I just procrastinated into oblivion. 

*Update: I’m an avid traveler. I know most of the tricks and best times to buy and all the search sites and how to track flight prices. My parents even retired and became travel agents for the perks since they travel a lot too. But for visiting my parents it’s often random, sudden, last minute. At the time I saw the 424 I wasn’t mentally prepared to buy. It was a casual search on if I was even going. Just so happened to be the best price then too.

101tq0c,1672708139.0,FRONTIER AIRLINES - My list of 10 rules to avoid getting screwed when flying with the worst American budget airline in 2023 [warning: long post],BlastedBrent,"Inspired by my own personal hell when dealing with Frontier these past couple years, I spent a good chunk of 2022 reading dozens of increasingly similar accounts of how Frontier's evolving anti-consumer practices have ruined/soured so many travelers' trips. This trend will likely only get worse in 2023, so I've decided to compile a list of the most absurd but common nonsense that myself and others have encountered with this budget airline, and some surprisingly easy options Americans have to avoid dealing with their lack of customer service, ridiculous fees, and no-refunds BS.

Flying Frontier can be okay, but as soon as something goes wrong (on their end)  prepare for a mess of infuriating gotchas, gross incompetence, and vacation-ruining time wasters. It's so bad that I cannot recommend Frontier to anyone but the most savvy, careful, or last-minute flyers.

***Skip to rule #10 if you want a tl;dr for the most important piece of advice I have for when things do go wrong that I'm amazed is rarely mentioned on this sub.***

\------**PART 1: 10 RULES TO NOT GET F\*CKED FLYING FRONTIER----**\--

These rules/warnings are in mostly ascending priority since they tend to build on one another, but feel free to skip around:

1. **Triple check the carry-on/backpack dimensions** and then subtract 1"" on each edge. Do you need to apply the slightest force to compress the bag into the little metal cubes they have at the gates to check its size? Good luck, they have been increasingly slapping some travelers with the \~$100 oversized bag fee even though their backpack can easily compress into the cube, and can certainly fit under the seat.
2. **Do not expect them to re-book you if your flight is cancelled.** Be aware of last minute flight prices, and never book a frontier flight when you know last minute flights can be 4-6x more than a regular airline, because in most cases Frontier will not eat the loss to rebook you. There are so many reports of them sticking people in shitty hotels for days to avoid a prompt but expensive rebook, and even stories of subsequent rebookings for an initially canceled flight! Dollar cost average that shit, it's often cheaper in the long run to pay a bit more for the non-budget airline where you're covered in the event of a cancellation, than have frontier pull a fast one on you and you're effectively out an extra $1k for a last-minute booking out of pocket, or worse--losing days of your planned trip upset and stuck in an airport/hotel.
3. **The 1-in-25 flight cancellation average is misleading, plan ahead.** Sure, you can rationalize that 1/25 flights are cancelled on average over the year, but the distribution of canceled flights is not a fair dice role. If you're flying during busy travel days, holidays, or notable weather events the odds that **your** particular flight is cancelled can be much higher than that 1/25 average. And you guessed it, these are the types of situations where last minute flights tend to be much more expensive than usual too! Not only are you more likely to have to book last minute due to a cancellation, you're forced to pay much more too--double whammy
4. **Never expect to reach a live  support person unless you are physically at the terminal**. You cannot reach a real person over the phone (I've tried over six times for 2+ hours on hold and got through once), and chat is outsourced to southeast asia and they are unable to process refunds/reimbursements (as is regular phone support), and 8/10 times chat either went completely afk or ended chat abruptly. I haven't personally confirmed this, but I've read on this sub that some frontier staff charge a $25 fee to have them help you with rebookings/changes at the airport!? Ironically, the one time I got to reach real frontier staff at an airline I was told that even they cannot process refunds or reimbursements and to try calling in! As of writing, I believe Frontier is the only American budget airline company to claim they are going chat-only support, but we'll see..
5. **Travel voucher credit is often worthless**. This is not southwest, you are heavily restricted in how you may use your voucher credit. New credit now typically expires in 90 days, must be in your name, is only usable on initial bookings, and is almost always subject to their absurd $50-$100 cancellation fees. There's also a weird scam going around where some people have had [their flight credit mysteriously used up](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/frontier-airlines-frontier-miles-program/2094123-i-victim-flight-credit-fraud.html#post34657766) by someone 1-2 days before it expires that is its own rabbit hole I have spent hours trying to decipher. If you accept the voucher and are unable to use it in time, you can kiss a real cash refund goodbye in most cases. (SEE RULE # 10)Despite consumer protections guaranteeing you a right to a refund with most unexpected cancellations, Frontier offers vouchers as ""easy"", immediate alternatives to those not willing to go through the process of requesting a refund through Frontier--wait on hold for several hours and filling out a silly, in my case BROKEN pdf form for a refund request that must be manually submitted and can take weeks to finally clear.
6. **Don't expect their online systems to work 24/7. Deadlines which incur fees are often effected by glitches/outages, and don't expect to be reimbursed when outages out of your control cost you $$ in additional fines** . For weeks forums and subs were plagued with complaints that voucher redemption systems were broken and travelers lost their credit after trying to use them dozens of times. Some spent HOURS trying to reach a live person, but support were unable to use it on their end, unable to extend the deadline, and unable to reinstate or issue new credits when they called again after they had expired, basically telling their customers to eat shit and accept the loss because their systems had some bug that made it quite literally impossible for even their own support staff to apply the customer's voucher. **This is absolutely unacceptable when you consider that vouchers are often pitched as a store-credit like alternative to those owed a refund**. One good example of system outages costing money is the cancellation/rebook functionality randomly failing for days at a time or certain flight numbers--forcing users to pay the \~$100 cancellation fee if they are unable to cancel the same business day they booked, making it more infuriating as you're wasting hours refreshing/retrying the site over and over + have multiple chats open + have two phones on hold desperately trying to reach a person before the clock counts down your $100 loss. Regular support staff cannot just reimburse you if ""the system"" is acting up and time passes, and if the system is down for you it tends to be down on their end too... Good luck
7. **Never expect a free cancellation/rescheduling even if you plan ahead, expect to pay $50-$100**. On paper, Frontier claims that cancellations are free within 24 hours and rebookings charge no extra fees if done 60+ days prior.  But, there are all sorts of reports of the fee being charged for cancellations made the next day, even if was within 24 hours of booking. Combine this with the notorious downtime/errors on their site, and it becomes comically difficult to cancel in time. I've booked a flight at the end of the day, had their site/service go down for the remainder of the night, canceled in the morning, and still been hit with a $100 fee. *If you book a flight that departs in less than 7 days, you will be hit with the $100 cancellation fee no matter what. Even if you try to cancel it immediately, it was officially considered too close to the real flight to be eligible for free cancellations the second you booked it*
8. **Don't check a bag unless you don't mind it being lost** Yes this applies to all airlines, and yes there is insurance, but the combo of being unable to reach a live person at Frontier combined with their absurd stinginess in refunds/reimbursements makes losing your bag particularly bad. It's genuinely not worth the time to try to do anything if your bag doesn't make it.
9. **Your carry-on is not always safe, you may be forced to check it anyway.** Often travelers are aware of the lost bag problem, so they pack their expensive/irreplaceable items in their carry-on to make sure it arrives at their destination with them.  Well, it's fairly often that bins fill up and the passengers in later boarding groups are forced to check their bags at the gate when they finally call them to board. These unexpected [forced carry-on checkings can and do go missing](https://www.businessinsider.com/british-airways-checked-in-bag-then-got-lost-2022-12) all the time, so be prepared to work something out or straightup refuse to board if you're carrying irreplaceable items in your carry-on and they tell you it needs to be checked. In some instances, the logistics of a last-minute bag checked at the gate make it more likely to be lost, especially if you have a connecting flight. Plan ahead and consider paying a tad more to board early and secure some overhead space, as it's never worth risking a last-minute forcibly checked bag if you've got something irreplaceable or very expensive you would never have checked in the first place.

If you've somehow made it this far, stick around for Rule #10. It has served me so well that in my opinion, it can make flying Frontier worth it... sometimes

# 10. ALWAYS book with an Amex credit card, do NOT waste your time contacting support and jumping through hoops for a refund, NEVER ACCEPT A VOUCHER WHEN YOU ARE OWED A REFUND

Kind of a mouthful, I know, but following rule #10 will make frontier a breeze and even negates you having to worry about several of the previous rules. Simply put, whenever something goes wrong that should warrant a refund, you do not need to waste hours trying to reach a real person at Frontier only to be told they can't do refunds and offer you some 90-day nonsense voucher if you complain hard enough. Instead fill out a claim to contest the charge through amex's website/app. The process takes two minutes on your phone--uploading docs and lengthy explanations are typically **not** needed. While it may take a couple weeks for the refund to appear on your account, kick back and relax as Amex handles dealing with Frontier's absurd refund paperwork for you. You do not need a paid amex card either, every $0 fee amex card has this perk.

**Why Amex?** Amex has a notoriously consumer-friendly process to contest charges, sides with their cardholders far more often than the competition, and has a streamlined process specifically tailored for their cardholders to request refunds for failed travel expenses(all major airline companies/rental companies included). Businesses and frequent flyers alike are aware that Amex works directly with airlines for these ""contested charges"" , to the point that some in the know will not even bother contacting southwest/united for refunds these days, and instead go straight to Amex to save time, headache, and most importantly demand a real refund instead of flight voucher credit.

**Why not contact Frontier and take a voucher?** Frontier has so much fine print around voucher expiration and redemption rules that it is a laughable substitute for a refund. (See Rule #5). If a flight is canceled and they do not make reasonable accommodations for you, which has been the case over and over again on budget travel subs, there are federal protections in place that give you the right to a refund, and your cardholder certainly agrees. But, Frontier is free to offer you an alternative to a refund--the easy and convenient travel voucher! If you waste your hours dealing with Frontier and accept their offer of a travel voucher, and then later you realize you got screwed with an unusable voucher that has expired, you might go try to file a claim with Amex to finally get a proper refund. Unfortunately, it would be too late, as Frontier will actually bother responding with evidence that you came to an agreement with them to accept a flight voucher instead of a refund. **So** **Amex will side with Frontier instead of you and deny the request,** forfeiting both your right to any sort of refund and your time.  So do not play into their voucher offer, do not waste your time agitated while on hold when you should be relaxing, and do not fill out their absurd forms and request callbacks for days in an effort for a refund when Amex is an option.

&#x200B;

\------**PART 2: Should anyone still fly Frontier when there is any other option available?----**\--

So, if you're armed with an Amex and are not financially constrained by the timing of a  potential chargeback, when is it a good idea to fly Frontier? In my opinion it's perfectly reasonable to fly Frontier when **all** of the following are true for you and your party:

* There are no connecting flights
* You are not checking a bag you care about, or are only traveling with a small backpack
* You are already booking last-minute, or competing last-minute flights in the instance of a last-minute Frontier cancellation are not unreasonably expensive given the risk vs upfront savings
* It's not a busy travel day/holiday/hectic time of the year
* You will not be cancelling or rescheduling your booked flight for any reason (Amex has your back here most of the time too, but iirc you can't keep abusing chargebacks to bypass the fees because you changed your mind over and over)
* **The Frontier flight is still considerably cheaper at the end of the day**",87,289,TravelHacks

Edit 8:22 AM MST: It's the next morning and I'm back at the Delta desk. They've overbooked EVERYTHING and are struggling to find us a new flight. There's been a lot of confusion, so here's the full explanation of the events.

The original flight was for ~12:45 AM. That got rescheduled on Friday afternoon for 2:05 AM. We arrived at the airport at 11:30 PM.

Waited in a long line of people for Delta to check our bags. No self-check available.

Delta checked our bags, gave us our ticket, and told us to go get on our flight. 

As we approached security, the TSA closed the doors and said ""we close at 1:00 AM. 20 people standing in line not knowing what to do. Someone ran back and told Delta, they said they were calling the TSA to get them to reopen for us.

More time passes and a representative of the airport shows up to tell everyone that ""Delta forgot to call the TSA and tell them that they rescheduled our flight.""

We all go back to the desk. Our bags were already on the plane. It departed without us. We sat for another few hours with the Delta desk agents while they rebooked everyone.

1f0y31n,1724597401.0,"Dream to visit all US States, from abroad. Is it just unrealistic? ",,"US travel - visiting all States

I live in London England and my dream has always been to visit every US state. I've always been fascinated by America. I'm reaching the age now when I really want to actually do it, my wife is keen to do it with me and I'm literally starting to think of logistics today. So it's at the earliest stage of planning. 

My first thought was to figure out a rough order of states. I'm leaving out Hawaii and Alaska for now. But I went on Google maps and typed in a few places per state and figured out the most sensible order to visit them, purely based on reducing the amount of coming back on myself and zigzagging.

I haven't yet figured out a million things, like how long it might take overall, whether it's best to break it up into 4/5 etc separate trips. I did like the idea of a campervan but a) I've never driven in America before and b) in places like NY, Vegas etc, I reckon I wouldn't really need a car/van at all for a while. 

But then I was thinking - let's say I go, and rely on buses and trains and subways to get around. That might not be possible in certain places, and I've no idea how I've bring enough luggage for such a long trip. 

If I was to do it in one single trip, there might be places that are better in certain months, or maybe even inaccessible in winter etc. Or maybe far too hot in summer. So,  I haven't factored in the time of year into the order I mapped out. 

I feel like my idea is starting to feel a bit silly and unrealistic. Which is fine, it was literally a dream with no knowledge behind it! 

Has anyone ever tried to do anything similar, and can point me towards websites I can use for research?  Any hints and tips? I'm happy for you all to call me an idiot haha. Really, I just need a sensible starting point and a sensible way of planning. 

Thanks in advance all.

16pc4g8,1695393731.0,Travel TIP - avoid international layovers less than 3 hours,shockedpikachu123,"While it may be obvious to some, may be it won’t be for those who don’t normally fly internationally.

The only exception is if you’ve been to that airport before and know what to expect. Typically when you land, you don’t know the layout of the airport. The transit gate can be next to each other or an hour walk from each other (for example: Istanbul or Madrid). There may also be a second TSA check which may add even more time. Plus in some places you need to get off and watch the never ending screen to find your gate number which can add another 5-10 minutes. 

Lastly, one more thing most people will forget to factor time in is TAKING A BUS TO THE PLANE. This happened to me in Vietnam, Qatar, and Jordan. Luckily I’ve never missed my flight but something to be aware of. I can’t imagine cutting it close to your flight come to find out you need to take a shuttle bus to the plane. Not sure how one can anticipate that but it’s better to be err on the side of caution and arrive an hour early.

I would also say 2 hours is fine if you’re more experienced but it can get dicey. If your layover is 2 hours, power walk and bee line to your gate, maybe bulldoze some people on the way, and no bathroom or snack breaks!",104,266,TravelHacks

1hkz3h7,1734992800.0,Tips for your checked bags,SuzRu2,"Hi. 
I’d just thought I’d share a few things that I do when I HAVE to check a bag. Most of these ideas were learned after mishaps. Hopefully they help make your travel smooth. 
1.  I decorated my bag. I used green electrical tape to put big polka dots on my otherwise generic blue bag. It’s easy for me to “spot” in the terminal and easier for folks to identify if I have to ask “have you seen a big blue bag”. 
2. I take pictures of my bag contents while packing. This really helps if you need a conversation about what was in your bag. It’s harder than you think to recall what you packed (I had to give an inventory once when things were stolen). 
3.  Air tag and a 3x5 card with my name/phone number and where I’m going. Usually I put the round trip info on the card so I can just use one card for both trips. Sometimes I also tag my bag outside with similar info (leaving off my name) destination and date (origin-> destination on xxdate for both legs). 
4. Extra ziploc style compression bags. 

Bon Voyage. ",53,263,TravelHacks

Edit 3? : gonna work on some more after work!!! It’s also really helpful if you know the main airports in the region. Ie: “I’m going to Athens, 2 main sirorts by there are Berlin and Barcelona” or whatever (… I know Spain isn’t that close. But Ryanair, lol) 

And! If you ever so inclined and use a flight I find, and you’re willing and able, throw a few bucks toward the Multiple Myeloma Foundation—- the type of cancer my dad passed of. He gave me the confidence to travel alone, always leaning into the fact that anything is possible :)

edit: please include how long or how soon or how many layovers you can stand... a little guidance is best!

Edit 2:
I responded with this to a question below, but here is the process I use:

I don't have a perfect system, but this is what I usually do:

    Within the USA:

There are many, many small, budget airlines that do not show up on search engines. I like to look at Allegiant Airlines, Frontier, Breeze Airways, Spirit (especially if I'm trying to get out west!)

For example: If I want to go CVG - PDX, I know I can't take a direct flight.

I'll see what Google Flights and Skyscanner says, and then I'll look up a one way from CVG to LAS on Spirit, because I know that Spirit is based out of Vegas and they have flights from Cincinnati frequently.

Thennnn I'll look LAS - PDX.

Sometimes the 2 Spirit tickets cost less than whatever Delta said. Sun Country airlines is also a great one, they are based out of MSP (Minneapolis).

So I often also look at CVG - MSP - PDX, seeing if Sun Country Airlines or Spirit is better.

The process is tedious, but the prices can vary a lot and it is worth it to me, as a college student.

If it is a longer trip, I would look at flying out of close airports, as that can change the price a bunch. Generally speaking, I've found that the bigger the airport, the cheaper, but there are obviously exceptions to the rule.

Within Europe OR USA to Europe; Europe to USA:

RyanAir is my best friend ever. Double check where the airport is, as some of their airports are far from the city center. But I personally don't think you can beat a 10 euro flight. RyanAir is based out of Dublin, so if you are looking to go to the states/North or South America, You can often find a cheap flight to Dublin or London, and then cross the ocean Dublin - New York, Chicago, etc.



BUDGET AIRLINES:

Spirit, Allegiant, and Fronteir often have 20 dollar off codes floating around. I always make sure to search for one before I book anything.

Random stingy thing I do:

After I have decided on my flights, if it is a major airline like Delta or United, I will buy a gift card online for that airline. I use cardcash.com and have not had any issues as a seller or buyer. So, I'll buy a 50 dollar gift card at 5% - 10% off. Obviously this is only a few bucks, but hey, it adds up over time.



TLDR:

If you are looking to cross an ocean and/or will need 2-4 flights to get to your destination, fly to the closest huge airport via cheap airline. (ie LAX, ORD)

Thennnnnn fly from big city to europe or whatever.

If you are going somewhere more obscure, it might be worth it to fly from EWR to Dublin and thennnnnn your destination, rather than EWR to destination that Google Flights says, as you could go from Dublin to Athens (for example) via RyanAir.

Google Flights is your best friend, Skyscanner is alright. I would also rec connecting your Delta account to your Lyft (...or Uber,, but I think it is lift) account, as you get miles for spending money on the app.",254,256,TravelHacks

I had returned from the beach around 11am and when I approached the room I was in there was a cleaning person inside making the bed. I was already in the room and decided to give them space but grabbed my luggage to then take it down to the lobby. On the way down to the lobby I realized anyone could just walk into a room that is open and claim to be the person and walk out with everything. If this happened close to home it would not be a big deal. But this was in another country. My passports, emergency cash, car keys, etc are all in that luggage. Sure the luggage is locked but what would that do for good if the entire luggage can be lifted away? 

I decided to before going to another foreign country trip, this time with a friend, to buy a thin cut proof rope like for bikes to be locked down and to then purchase a TSA approved padlock. Whenever there was nobody in the room before leaving I would tie the luggage down to something like a large table or something that would be very hard to move. My friend said to just put the valuables in the safe that is secured. I said hotel safes are not secure. They have overrides that are hackable in seconds.

 The issue is that when you select the e-receipt option, you're not told at that moment how much your bill is. And many a times, the rental car companies will end up charging you random fees which you'll find days later. In my experience, when I have asked for the e-receipt, 50% of the time I have been put charges that I wasn't expecting but when I have asked for the printed version, I have never been hit with random charges. 

The random charges include fuel filling charges (which didn't happen when I had less than full fuel upon receipt and I asked for the printed receipt), and specific location ""surcharges"". 

The worst was when I was involved in an accident and then I retured the car I was expecting a bill of $74 for the 2 day rental but instead got a $375 bill. The charges were ""5 day charges"" for $150 and ""1-Wk charges"" for $150. I was so confused, I think that Avis thought that I would find it cheap that I got away with an accident for $300 so I'll pay it but na-ah, I paid for insurance so I am not paying more. When I called avis to understand those charges they acted confused and then gave me the money back in 2 mins. 

I understand that asking for e-receipt in the future is faster, and if you can't wait for the print out, make sure you know your final bill before leaving. It will be way faster than calling your car rental later to get charged reduced!

1c3qhq0,1713090695.0,Why I Always Travel with a Second Phone: A Travel Hack for some Peace of Mind,flyingchocolatecake,"I've been lucky so far. I've never had my smartphone stolen. But I wanted to know: What if? So, I simulated the whole thing, switched off my smartphone, and tried to access all my important documents. It turns out that it's not so easy - especially if you use 2FA almost everywhere.

That's when I realized the importance of having a backup plan, especially when traveling far away from home. Being prepared to expect the unexpected can make all the difference between a smooth trip and a stressful nightmare.

Enter the one thing I'll never travel without: A second phone. It's my previous smartphone with a pre-paid SIM card that I always keep separate from my main phone. It either stays in my hostel/hotel room or it's being kept in a separate bag when on the road. Having a secondary phone gives me peace of mind, knowing that if my primary phone is lost, stolen, or damaged, I have a backup ready to go. This backup phone serves multiple purposes:

1. It has a secondary phone number I can use to make calls in case of emergencies.
2. It contains important documents, such as my passport, travel itinerary, and insurance information.
3. It contains essential apps, such as my password manager, my email account and relevant apps for the journey (e.g. airline apps).
4. I can easily deactivate my main phone remotely using this secondary device.
5. Perhaps most importantly, I can activate my main line on the secondary phone using an eSIM, which can be done through my provider's website. This means I can quickly regain access to my primary phone number without needing a physical SIM card.

So my advice to other travelers who might have an old phone at home or about to replace their current phone: Maybe reconsider selling it. Set it up with a pre-paid SIM and crucial information. It's a simple travel hack that can save you from a lot of stress and inconvenience should the worst happen.

When I replace my current smartphone at some point, I will also keep this one and set it up as a third emergency phone - which will always stay at home. Like a third line of defense to at least get easy access to my stuff once I return.",67,239,TravelHacks

1h63bw8,1733273266.0,How do you regulate BMs when traveling?,champ_neffew,"I’m not sure how common this problem is for people, but I tend to become brutally constipated when I’m away from home. If you don’t care to read about the intricacies of my daily trips to the porcelain throne, I advise you to stop reading now.

It doesn’t matter what I’m eating, drinking, how much I’m sleeping, whether I’m staying hydrated, how the toilet is shaped, whether I’m alone or traveling with people. I could be halfway around the world in a 5 star hotel, or spending the weekend at an Air BnB an hour from home. The result is the same. 

I typically will not have a BM for the first couple days, during which time I will become increasingly bloated and uncomfortable. After that, I will begin to experience urgent BMs after each substantial meal, all of which are difficult and none of which are satisfying. 

Upon returning home, everything immediately returns to normal. As soon as I enter my apartment, I beeline to the toilet where my bowels unclench and a backlog of repressed turds are unleashed. My schedule then returns to normal. One BM in the morning after coffee, and another in the evening or late afternoon. 

Please, can anyone relate and if so, has anyone come up with an effective solution? It is extremely uncomfortable and reduces the enjoyment I get from food, sex, and various travel activities.

Follow up:

Thank you all for the advice. I decided to start with Metamucil and hydration and see where that gets me. If it doesn’t work, I’ll ramp up to some of the more drastic remedies. I took a tablet last night and this morning, and I’ve downed about a gallon of water since posting. 

Follow up part deuce:

About 24 hours after beginning the Metamucil/water protocol, I had a downright glorious defecation and felt great afterward. That’s a great result in the short term, but I want to make sure I am able to establish a decent rhythm so I’ll update again in a couple days. 

Final update:

At first, the Metamucil/water protocol was only intermittently successful. Short stretches of comfortable BMs alternated with difficult battles against my bowels. After some trial and error, I was able to establish a good rhythm, achieving almost (but not quite) as good as my home field performances. Here are my 3 takeaways:

1. Metamucil is very convenient and it works wonders. However, I ended up needing to take 2 pills at a time to realize the benefits consistently.
2. The Metamucil doesn’t work without water. And lots of water. It can be difficult to consume a sufficient amount when out and about doing travel things. In addition to a morning coffee, I tried to drink a liter after waking up and as much as I could throughout the day. 
3. When at home, I go when I feel the urge, and everything goes smoothly. However, while battling my stubborn travel BMs, this was a losing strategy. I found a lot more success waiting as long as I could before finally sitting down to take the Browns to the Super Bowl. I don’t want to go into detail here but I feel waiting gave my system time to compact the payload for a cleaner, more efficient delivery.

Hopefully this is helpful to people who share my plight. I’m surprised and somewhat relieved that so many people can relate. ",281,230,TravelHacks

12kyg1z,1681410451.0,"Sharing Some Tips/Thoughts Based on My Recent Trip to Lisbon, Portugal",DashiellHammett,"I recently spent 16 days in the Lisbon area: 4 nights in Lisbon, 6 nights in Cascais, and then 6 nights back in Lisbon. Here are some things I learned/discovered and offer as some pointers or suggestions for others visiting these areas. (I meant to post this right after I got back, so I may have forgotten a couple things; however, feel free to message me with questions, and I will try to answer the best I can.)

1. Uber: Taking an Uber from the airport after arrival is definitely the way to go, although finding the pickup location was not obvious, even though I had researched it before. You go out of the airport and turn right. Walk past the entrance to the Metro station, then look for stairs or elevator up to the arrivals area. There is a parking lot for dropping off and picking up folks. A lot of Uber drivers try to time it so they can drop someone off and pick someone up one right after the other (to save the entrance fee to the parking area, I think). So don’t get thrown off if the car Uber told you was picking you up has someone in it at first. I also took an Uber back to the airport when I left. It was under 20 €. 

2. Metro: As best I could tell, at least for the ticket machines that I used, the instructions are in Portuguese. I wish I would have watched a YouTube video before trying to use one. I ended up buying a 24-hour pass, although not entirely on purpose. The 24-hour pass is a good deal if you are using the Metro a lot for a given day, which I did not end up doing and thus I probably lost a bit of money on the deal. Getting a card you can reload probably makes more sense if you are going to be in town for multiple days. Also, when you are getting a card for the first time, there is a 0.50€ charge for the card. NOTE: the card comes out where the receipts come out. There are usually tons of receipts that people leave behind, so you kind of have to dig to find your card. It took me a couple minutes to figure out where the card came out. But, except for the buying of tickets, the Metro is easy to use in terms of figuring out how to get somewhere and identifying stops and stations and such. And I never felt unsafe.

3. Lisboa Card: The Lisboa Card is great. If you buy one online in advance, pick it up at the airport. You have to walk right by the place you pick it up on your way to the Uber area. (I did not do this in my rush to get to my hotel, but I wish I had.) You can also pick up the card, OR just buy one without having purchased it online, in the History of Cod Visitor Center by the Praça do Comércio (big square on the water downtown). I found buying the card online a bit confusing, because so many different sites sell the card (probably to get a commission). And figuring out what the “official” site was is not obvious (or even if there is an “official” site.) But, still, I highly recommend getting the card. What makes it a great deal is that it works on all the transit except for the ferries. This was my favorite part practically. Using the Lisboa Card is way easier to use than buying tickets for the Metro and quickly pays for itself in saving transit costs. But to get maximum value, you definitely want to plan your visits so that you can hit multiple places with free or reduced-fee entrance in the same area. Belem works great for that. And if you are organized like me, the 3-day card is a great deal.

4. Getting to Belem: You can Uber it, but I ultimately found transit was easier. (Plus I also like taking transit and consider that part of experiencing a place.) The #15 Tram (or 15E for the electric tram) is super popular with tourists and it gets crowded. I much preferred taking the #728 Bus. You catch both outside the Cais do Sodré train station, which is where is the first or last stop of both. There is usually a big crowd to get on the bus. Go to the front of the bus stop to wait, because you have to get on through the front door. You can pay for tickets on board, but people behind you in line will grumble. Again, I loved the Lisboa card for this reason. The return trip to Lisbon also has a first stop, and you definitely want to get on there. If you are at the second or third stop, the tram/bus will sometimes not even stop if it is already full. By the way, I was there in March, which is low season, and it was still pretty busy. I can’t even imagine how crazy it is during summer.  

You can also take the Cascais train to Belem. You catch the train at the Cais do Sodré train station, which is also a Metro station. But if taking the train, PAY ATTENTION because not every Cascais train stops at Belem. Some are expresses. I made this mistake in both directions, watching Belem go by from the train and then having to catch the bus. Taking the train is by far the fastest way to get to Belem, assuming you get on a train that stops there. The stop where you get off in Belem is very close to everything too. 

There is a lot to see and do in Belem. I spent a morning and afternoon there on two different days, and still did not get to everything, *e.g.*, the Belem Tower, which is a bit of a walk from the majority of other places. 

5. What to do on Monday. Most museums and tourist sites are closed on Monday, but not all. It helps to some research to find out what is open and plan your day accordingly. The Castle (in Alfama) is not closed on Monday, so that was one thing I did. I also visited the Museu Coleção Berardo and Jose Saramago Foundation/Museum, which are also open. Monday is also a great day to visit one of the beautiful parks in Lisbon. And most of the historic Cathedrals are also open to visit on Monday (and some often closed on Sunday). 

6. Visiting the Castle St. George. For goodness sakes, buy your ticket online, in advance. By 10 AM, the line to buy tickets is really long, while there is almost never a line to get in if you have already bought your ticket. You just show your ticket on your phone, and you’re in. This place is super popular to visit, although I did not find it all that interesting. The views are spectacular. And there is a small museum with archeological artifacts and interesting history about the site. The place is more like a beautiful park with peacocks strutting about. I am glad I visited, but I can’t strongly recommend it if you are visiting for a single day and you have a lot of other things you are considering. PLUS it is at the top of the very tall hill that is Alfama, and it is a long walk. There is a bus that runs to the castle. There is also two elevators that seem not to be used much or well known. See here for information: [https://www.weheartlisbon.com/en/sights/elevador-castelo ](https://www.weheartlisbon.com/en/sights/elevador-castelo%20%0d7)

[7](https://www.weheartlisbon.com/en/sights/elevador-castelo%20%0d7). Jeronimos Monastery (in Belem): If you have a Lisboa Card, admission is free AND you get to skip the ticket line, which is a bit of a walk from where you stand in line to get in. Go in the morning, or late afternoon. Midday, the lines are LONG because of tour busses and such. And I was there in March. I can’t even imagine what it is like in summer. I think that the Monastery was definitely worth a visit (given my Lisboa card). But it is mainly a walk around the monastery to see its architecture. There is very little in the way of information about its history etc. It is not a museum. But it is beautiful. **Another key thing to know:** the adjacent Church, which is beautiful, has a SEPARATE line to get in, and this line gets even longer than the line to get into the monastery. Admission is free, but it can be a long wait because they only let so many inside at one time. If you get there and see the line to get into the church (cathedral) is short, jump in that line first. The line to get into the Monastery moves a whole lot faster. 

8. Churches, Churches, Everywhere: There are a LOT of cathedrals and churches in Lisbon, and I went into most of them. If you don’t have the time that I did, here are the ones that I recommend you not miss. First and foremost, Monastery of São Vicente de Fora and its connected cathedral. You enter through the monastery and admission is 4€ (I think), that also allows you into the cathedral. I spent over an hour here. Lots of information, beautiful artifacts, rotating exhibits of art, and AMAZING views. Second, if you are already in Alfama and heading back down, the Lisbon Cathedral is worth a visit, because it has some shared history with St. Vincent Cathedral. Finally, the Carmo Convent and Museum is really incredible. The Convent is in ruins from the huge 1755 Lisbon earthquake. It is amazing that the ruins were intentionally preserved, and now also serves as a site for a great archeological museum. This was one of my favorite places. (Right next door is also the Museum of the Republican National Guard, which I found really interesting as well.)

9. Two of My Favorites Things I Visited: There was so much I loved in Lisbon, and I am very glad I dedicated the numbers of days I did to visiting there. One of my favorite things was the Museu do Aljube – Resistência e Liberdade, which is a museum dedicated to the several decades in which Portugal was run by a fascist dictator, and how a revolution brought it down. I knew some of the dictatorship, but I had no idea how oppressive and totalitarian it was. This museum taught me a lot. The other rather odd place that I find myself still thinking about is the Marionette Museum. It is not only about the interesting history of puppets in Portugal, but also about puppetry in other cultures. I loved this museum. It is also near the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga so visits to both places are easy to combine. The latter has a lovely small park area with great views where you can rest a bit.

Okay, this got much longer than I thought it was going to be. I will probably cover Cascais and my visit to Sintra in a second posting. Again, feel free to ask questions if you want.",67,222,TravelHacks

13wrxjl,1685552741.0,Using budget compression sacks to save money on luggage fees.,,"I noticed that Wirecutter did a short article on using compression sacks for people who overpack or those who want to save money on luggage fees. I would like to share some additional insights. I have been using compression sacks for the past 17 years, and for the last 10 years, I have been using them for travel. Compression sacks can be quite expensive, just like other camping gear. The Wirecutter article recommends a few bags that are not budget-friendly.

After using different bags over the past two decades, I highly recommend the Aegismax stuff sacks. They offer the best value for your money and will cost you $5-$16, depending on whether you buy them on Amazon or AliExpress. These sacks are durable and long-lasting. I have used them for bike touring and traveling, and I have yet to experience any broken buckles or fabric tears, unlike with name brand stuff sacks that have failed on me.

If you are a budget airline traveler with a one-bag approach, I suggest purchasing the xxs or xs small sizes because they tend to run a bit large. Using four or five xxs small compression sacks, I have been able to fit three weeks' worth of clothing or two weeks' worth of winter clothing in a personal item bag.

xo19w6,1664145376.0,You Cannot Trust Expedia with Accommodations,Hero911,"We just had the worst experience possible with Expedia.  We had booked a condo in BC for 2 nights using their platform and informed the property that we were showing up at 1am.  A few nights before the booking we reaffirmed our 1am arrival time.  Their response both times were ""just call the property manager at \[number\] and they will give you a key"".  Upon arrival it was apparent that there was a music festival happening in the area.  We tried calling the property manager (the only way to check in) at 12:30am with it going straight to voicemail and a full inbox.  We continue to call every 10 minutes and start to get worried around 1:20am with the same result.  We walk to the nearest hotel in the meantime and inquire about rooms with them.  They say that all the rooms in the area are booked and we are the 100th people to ask.  We go online using every service we know and every hotel is completely booked for 200km.  Upon calling around 40 hotels, we came across one which had an ""emergency room"" which cost 3x the original price of the entire trip.  Not wanting to sleep on the street, we had to take an uber 100km to this location.  We had continued to call the phone number up until we got into the room at 4am.  It was pretty clear that the property had rented out the property to someone for the music festival with the demand.  

We get a message from the property company claiming that the manager had an ""emergency"" and that our room was now ready for the 2 night stay.  We told them that what they did was unacceptable and proceed to book a different hotel after all the stress they caused.  Since we booked on what we thought was a reputable platform (expedia), we believed that we were safe with how they would handle it.  After spending about 5 hours with their customer service, they refused to give a refund.  Even though they can see the chat logs, saw their ""check in procedure"", and also saw that they admitted fault that nobody could check us in, they flat out refused to give any refund.  

My advice would be that if you need to use the service, do NOT book anything but a hotel with a 24 hour concierge. We are filing a claim currently with the credit card used for the booking.",69,208,TravelHacks

Thank you everyone! Some additional info about me:

1. I make just over 6k/mo and can work from anywhere in the world.

4. If I do this, I would take my 18 year old daughter.

1. I have full coverage insurance through my work.

2. I don’t drive in the US due to multiple complications with some spinal surgeries. Walking does me good.

Hi guys, probably not the best time to post this with the whole COVID-19 situation going on, but I've been developing this for the past 5 months whenever I had free time after work or on weekends and I am excited to just get this out.

##What is it?
The name of the website is More Than One City. You can access it by clicking here [More Than One City](https://morethanonecity.com) or going to morethanonecity.com. It is a website users that are undecided and want to visit multiple cities can find cheap flights. An added feature is that it will display the cheapest flight going back home from that city you want to visit. As a Canadian that likes to visit more than one city, flying back home is always more expensive and and it was hard to find which cities had the cheapest flight home(to Canada).


There are currently two functionalities 1) **Quick Search** and 2) **Trip Builder**. 

### Quick Search
Quick Search are for the spontaneous that have already decided on where to go and want to visit an additional city.

##### How does it work?
Simply enter your home city / closest airport to you, the first place you're visiting and the date you want to leave for that next city. More Than One City will return cities that are the cheapest to fly to and display how much it is to fly back home. From there, you select the city and find the flight you want to take. 

### Trip Builder (Mostly done - still thinking of ways to improve and still trying to find bugs)
Trip Builder are for the undecided travelers that just want to get away. 

##### How does it work?
You simply enter your home city or the closest airport to you, a city you want to go to and the date you want to leave. More Than One City will find the cheapest flight to that city. If you don't like that flight, simply click on the ""See More Flights to [City]"" to find more flights that suit you. Once clicking on a flight, another search form will appear. From there simply enter **a country or region** and select the date you want to leave. More Than One City will return cities that are the cheapest to fly to and display how much it is to fly back home. Upon selecting a flight, you have the choice to add up to 4 more legs to your trip (with the last leg being your flight home).


### How do you book the flight?
Click on the Book Here link. It will take you straight to the airline website and there you just have to enter in the city you've decided to go to along with the date you have decided on going. Just search for the flight number similar to what you selected on More Than One City. More Than One City currently does not have a functionality to redirect you to the flight you selected (like on Google Flights). Hoping to add this functionality as soon as I figure it out.


### Thoughts?
Please let me know what you think. If there are any bugs or issues please feel free to message me. I really am passionate about this project and want to keep improving it.",21,196,TravelHacks

So I am aware opening a new credit card gives you 100k+ points or so as a welcome package. I got one when opening Chase Sapphire Reserve. I used it to book an international flight (although I learned today I only got some 1.2cpp - could have done better had I know about the concept of cpp). 

Anyway, now that I used this big chunk of points last November, I have only managed to get some 30k points in 6 months. Regular house hold spending, occasional home improvement spending etc.  By this, it looks like I can only get to use my points for anything big would be next year.

So, my understanding is on average you would need two years to gather all the points needed (without opening a new credit card) - that too being frugal about the points and not using it for domestic flight in those two years.

Am I understanding it right that we ""save"" points for multiple years to take that one international trip using points that makes it all worth? Or is there some hack that I am oblivious too that let people travel on points more frequently?",203,197,TravelHacks

11shc0t,1678933270.0,Avoid Priceline for airline tickets if you want to get home,Zhenja92,"Just a reminder that if you buy a ticket through Priceline and the airline cancels the ticket, Priceline cannot and will not guarantee that you will get home without having to buy a new ticket, they are incapable of working with the airline to get the tickets that were sold through Priceline honored, and they allow the airlines to refund only a small fraction of the actual cost of the cancelled ticket. I had tickets from Zagreb  to Seattle on Priceline last July. Lufthansa cancelled the flight because they chose to sell tickets that they did not have the staff to fly. My travel insurance wouldn't pay, because Lufthansa was contractually obligated to get me home. Unfortunately, I had to work with Priceline to rebook - and even though Lufthansa was obligated to rebook, Priceline dropped the ball. I got a refund that was one third of what it cost me to get home (both because the refund did not reflect the higher cost of cities on my return leg and because I was having to buy a last minute ticket). It took me seven months to get an answer from Priceline - which came down to, you are stupid idiot for buying a ticket from us because how could you possibly think we would get you home (paraphrased, but basically their answer was that they were under no obligation to get me home, and refunding a small fraction of the ticket is all that I could expect.) 

Here is the response to stranding me on another continent:  

Upon investigating your case, I can confirm that  there was an involuntary cancellation for the inbound portion of the  flight. To our regret an alternative option could not be offered by the  airline so in such cases we can only raise a refund request for the  unused ticket. 

Allow me to underline that  whenever a flight is canceled, we will endeavor to rebook you on to the  next available flight in the same cabin, but it is always in the matter  of availability. In case the customer was inconveniently assisted, we  want to take the opportunity and apologise for the frustration created.

Thus, we placed a request for a partial refund instead. In response to the query, assistance was provided by the service team. ",60,196,TravelHacks

Edit: thanks so much for all the great suggestions! I’m trying out SeeingAI to check that it will work on signs; if not, seems like BeMyEyes would pair him with a volunteer that could help him navigate. It’s also really helpful to know that DSM is such a small airport.

He is partially sighted, able bodied, and usually pretty good at getting around cities with the help of his earbuds and google maps yelping into his ear.

The car was a bit on the rougher side for a rental but given how busy it was I didn’t care. I took pics and vids of all the minor scuffs and scrapes. Also notified an employee of a small chip in the windshield, he said it was fine.

Anyways today I get a letter from Avis that was basically two lines long saying I was going to be charged $514 for glass repair. I sent an email to the address in the letter simply asking for any and all documentation related to the claim and I would require it before my credit card is charged. I received a response stating that your photos aren’t taking of minor damage and that the vehicle was removed from service for repairs. I then sent an email stating that their response was fine but I would need some type of bill or receipt to indicate what the $514 was paying for because right now all I have is two lines out of the blue saying I owe $514. Avis then emails back and says that their sorry for thr inconvenience and that they’re are closing the claim without charging my card

My point is, not that it’s a new thought, but take detailed photos of your rental and keep them for a LONG time.

Also is anything above normal? I barely gave any pushback and they immediate dropped it, almost like they send these letters out and just hope nobody follows up on it.

Now after the trip I contacted AVIS to see if they would refund me the difference because I was downgraded from the Suburban to the Pacifica. They wrote back and told me that I would not be getting a refund because I was in fact upgraded, not downgraded.

Why does AVIS consider going from an $80,000 SUV to a $40,000 minivan an upgrade???

EDIT: Update - I replied to their email pleading my case and they responded by saying they will refund $60. They switched up pretty quickly with no explanation behind the previous answer. It is not  as much as the difference would have been if I just booked a minivan in the first place but at least it is something.

In one case (SeaTac), we went through customs, then security again, then walked across the airport, then took a train, then took ANOTHER train, then walked all the way through the terminal to the very last gate, then got herded on to a bus, then drove across the tarmac for 10 minutes, then climbed stairs to get to the plane. People were eyeing it with a mix of awe and skepticism, as if we were afraid this mythical plane might not even exist at the end of our journey.

I rarely fly budget airlines--it's typically major players like Delta, United, Lufthansa, American, British Airways, etc. I get that a small short-distance plane might get bumped to the nosebleed seats, so to speak, but this seems to happen every time even when we board a large plane for a trans-Atlantic flight.

Is this a Travel Karen move or does anyone have sympathy?

o5t0ni,1624384484.0,Scott's Cheap Flights Elite vs Luxury Flight Club?,HerbertScytale,"Hey all,

I've been on Scott's email list for 5 years (so almost since the beginning) and a Premium member for more than half of that. I just found out about this Elite tier they just added and I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Basically they're locking premium economy and above behind yet another higher pay tier when those just used to be included in Premium (and just included in the free list before that). That just feels wrong to me to take features away from existing users and tell them if they want those back they'll have to pay more. 

Scott's always felt like it leveled the playing field for people who might not get to experience better-than-economy seating and this just feels like they just hung them out to dry. And for what? The ability to hire more staff to grow and support this new membership tier? Why is that even needed? The service is great as it is, and there shouldn't be this incessant need for growth for a company that revolves around scraping existing fare data from existing fare sites. 

This is a company that was started with help from Reddit, so I felt like I had to express my disappointment here (Scott's post in r/entreprenuer from 5 years ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4kpo2l/update\_i\_created\_a\_cheap\_flights\_email\_list\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4kpo2l/update_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/)). 

It's become clear that supporting their own growth is more important than providing a unique service to their customers from the rest of the classically divided travel industry. 

How does this Elite tier compare to one of the existing free sites like Luxury Flight Club? I'm really curious to hear.",76,172,TravelHacks
1fybbtf,1728317110.0,Why you shouldn’t ignore Airbnb listings with no reviews,ButterscotchFormer84,"So many people discount airbnb listings with no reviews. I think you’re missing out on potentially good places if you do that.

If an Airbnb listing has no reviews, click into the profile of the host. The host may be an experienced host with many reviews - if they have many positive reviews in their profile, then it is only that listing that is new, not the host, and chances are, they are gonna be a good host. You may even get a good deal because the listing is new, and new listings are often cheaper. 

I only discount airbnbs listings that have no reviews for both the listing AND the host.

I did some research and apparently it's a thing, especially ""The German stare"" and also how many lack personal spacing.

1f7lhkb,1725320431.0,Know Before You Book Your Trip To Vegas,bennigan_getthecar,"Just had to give someone bad news on this topic, and thought it was important to share on a larger scale.

This can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars!  If your trip to Vegas isn’t to attend a specific event that’s happening, answer the following questions.  If you answer yes to any of these, I’d strongly recommend modifying your dates.

This is not a full list and I’m sure I missed some things, but these are definitely 12 good questions to ask before you lock in your trip to Vegas.

Purpose of this post:  the goal is simply to highlight some of the biggest recurring events in Vegas when room rates are inflated because of how many people attend these events.  What people consider a high price is subjective.  Having more information available helps you make a better decision.

Rock and Roll Marathon is the exception on the list.  Prices do jump a little for the event, but it shuts down the entire strip and is not as easy to hop from one property to another.

This post is not meant to capture every event Vegas has, non-recurring events (ie. Vegas hosting the Super Bowl), or be an indication of how crowded a property might feel just because the room rates are high.  It’s also not meant to inform on coming/going based on the demographic that an event draws.

Additional tip:  if you are going to any of these events, check for price drops up until your stay begins.  Generally, you can cancel your reservation up until 72 hours before, but you can still get a lower rate if it’s available the day of.  I’ve called the morning of trips before heading to the airport to lock in lower rates.  You can’t, however, do this when checking in.

xoayqd,1664172563.0,Useful travel tips you should know and how to find cheap flights,hellopt7,"As someone who’s been traveling 2-3 times a month for the last year or so, here are some useful tips that I’ve learned and wanted to share:

1. NEVER book third party - it’s not worth it. You can absolutely find cheap flights by booking directly with the airlines. There has been a lot of travel delays and cancellations. Despite what people think, you absolutely will get compensated (within the airline’s delay/cancellation policies) when booked directly with the airlines than with a third party. That means free rebooking on another flight, hotel/food vouchers, reimbursements, and/or cash compensation. The money you’re saving by booking third party is not worth the stress when issues arise.

2. Another benefit from booking directly with airlines is that you can “rebook” your flights if the price drops and you can get back the difference in flight credit or even cash depending on the airline - if the airline offers no change fees. Most people book their flights and forgets about them until their trip. However, you absolutely should be checking your flights at least once a week to see if the price drops (which usually happens 90% of the time for me since I book pretty far in advance) and rebook the same flight at no cost and get back the difference. I’ve saved so much money this way and the money saved goes towards more flights. You don’t get this benefit when you book via third party. 

3. Track your flights before booking them. There are numerous sites where you can track your flights but I like using Google Flights. 

4. A great way to find cheap flights is using Scott’s Cheap Flights. It does require a membership but it’s absolutely worth it. Split the membership with friends or family members. The site does all the searching for you. You just set your favorite departing airports, domestic or international flights and fare type (economy, business, first class). You’ll get daily emails/alerts on cheap flights, mistake fares, etc. This is where I find the best deals - $200-400 roundtrip economy flights to Europe.

5. If you can, stay loyal to an airline. Ideally one that is your favorite and that you fly with frequently. You can earn airline status by being loyal to an airline to get free upgrades and other perks.

6. Have at least one travel credit card and book your flights using a travel credit card - NEVER purchase flights with a debit card. There are so many benefits to having a travel credit card from sign up bonuses (points to redeem for free flights and hotels), airline status, hotel status, car rental status, car rental insurance, travel insurance, airport lounge access, etc. Some of the best travel credit cards are: Chase Sapphire Preferred/Reserve, Capital One Venture X and AMEX Platinum.

7. Last but not least, the biggest tip I have is DO NOT pick your trips based on the destinations you want to visit but rather pick your trips based on the flight sales/promotions. For example, I just saw and booked a flight from Texas to Belize for $145 a few days ago not because I planned to visit Belize but because I saw the cheap fare so I jumped on it. This allows me to visit places that weren’t originally on my radar and I get to travel often for very cheap. I also don’t have specific dates in mind and pick the dates with the cheapest fare. I know that not everyone has this luxury but if dates aren’t an issue for you, this is a great way to travel for cheap. 

Hope these travel tips are helpful. Safe and happy travels!",48,161,TravelHacks

This group of women, for the most part, are not even mothers, they rotate children of different ages and instead of asking for money they ask you. in broken English that you buy them formula milk (which is very expensive here) and diapers in huge packages.

They refused to let me speak with a manager, claiming nobody was available, and hung up on me three times!

I called again, requesting a refund. They are now claiming that I agreed to the original rebooking of the flight (I did not!). They told me they have to go listen to all the recorded calls, and confirm I never agreed to a rebooking.

I am entitled to a refund here, correct? On the phone I said ""per your policy, if a traveler experiences a significant travel change, they are entitled to a refund"" and she responded with ""correct"" before claiming I've agreed to a rebooking and can no longer have a refund.

Thank God I had a small bag of band-aids tucked in my backpack from a previous trip. It made me realize how important it is to keep certain essentials because you never know when you’ll need it/forget it

When you get back home, don’t unpack the bag. Leave behind band aids, alcohol prep pads, a toothbrush, toothpaste contact lens solution/tylenol (within expiration), or whatever small things you tend to forget but are necessary. Pack a small bag of these items and leave it in all your travel bags so you’ll never forget 

It’s always the little things we forget to pack while frantically trying to not forget passports, phones and bigger items. Future you will thank you!

They offered to put me on a morning flight on 1/1/23 when my original flight was scheduled for early evening.

I showed up to airport about 2.5 hrs ahead of my flight. Super nice duo working the check in counter and helped me get a confirmed seat after 20-30 min of calling into their help desk and being on hold for a while.

But when I try to search for ""cheap flights to X"" or some variation thereof, inevitably, what I get is a bunch of ads for Expedia, Kayak, etc, all offering FANTASTIC (as in, a literal fantasy) prices for ""round trip"" flights, but only in the link.  Once you click on the link, their page is typically offering nothing close to that, with their best deals usually approaching double the advertised price in USD.

I never see these ""last minute bookings"" they're so fond of advertising.  My entire knowledge on the subject says to get a better deal I should

A) Book about 2 months out from departure date.
B) Travel during a low tourism time.
C) Fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday
D) Accept that I probably won't be flying direct.

Even with all of that, I'm not fining these sub 600 USD round trip flights to Asia I keep hearing about.  I've never been and would love to go.  I don't mind visiting during a rainier month if it's that much better of a deal.

wbz11b,1659192031.0,What are the biggest scams or tourist traps you have seen while traveling?,,"TLDR: What are some scams or tourist traps you have seen while traveling? I'm curious to see what some of you have seen. 

What comes to my mind: 

1. How in many Mexican/Caribbean airports there are ""travel"" stands and salespeople who try to convince you they are associated with your hotel, but really are a timeshare company. I had one of my friends who went on her honeymoon and her/spouse were kind of ""adultnapped"" and brought to a random location for a timeshare meeting. These salespeople are super convincing. 

2. Also in Mexico/Caribbean how hotels will tell you they have a ""free gift"" and try to talk to you about timeshares for an hour. Or, similarly they say your breakfast is free if you sit through an hour meeting etc. 

3. So many in Rome, but one being the large amount of scammers selling fake tickets outside the Colosseum.

4. Paris, where gypsies will masquerade as metro/subway/train attendants and try to help tourists get a ticket, charging an extra fee. 

5. Everywhere, where someone selling roses will try to set one on your table or try to ""give"" you a flower and then come back later trying to charge. 

6. Basically everything in Bali. Walking outside the airport and having to hold onto your luggage for dear life because there are so many men trying to help you take your luggage to a car/bus and trying to charge you for this fee. 

I think there are more, but these are the first things that come to my mind. So many of these people above are just trying to make money to better their lives, but at the tourists expense of course. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but I am saying these things can be helpful to know before visiting certain places.",92,151,TravelHacks

I travel 4 months a year.  So I needed some streamlined solutions.

Here’s what I’ve found for coping strategies:  

The night before departure, I put an insulated coffee cup in the fridge.  As I go out the door, I put all my syringes in the cup, with the lid on.  This keeps them cool for a full, 24-hour travel day until I get to a fridge. I can fit 12-15 syringes in a cup.

I got a BD brand needle clipper for $15.  This cuts off & stores the needle so the syringe can be safely thrown in the trash. After 5 years, I still haven’t filled it up.  I hated that sharp shuttle.

I ask my doctor for a written paper prescription updated every year, which I keep with my auto injector.  In case I’m stranded in country, I can get it refilled at a pharmacy there and sort out the $ later.  I keep all my meds, auto injector, and prescription together with me in my carry on.  

I hope these can help.

10zrr4i,1676133558.0,"Do NOT use TravelArrow, PlanMoreTrips, or any third party chrome extension that promises lower rates on flights/hotels. There is a reason why the rates are cheaper.",PutinsCumSlut,"When you book a flight or a hotel through a third party like Kayak, Priceline, or Booking.com, there will be many restrictions on your flight or hotel stay:

1. You do not receive loyalty points or miles that you can use to redeem additional flights or hotel nights. Using points to book flights/hotels can give you extremely good value (i.e. [you can stay almost a whole month at Hilton Bali with just 90k Hilton points](https://suitesmile.com/blog/2019/11/16/review-staying-in-hilton-garden-inn-bali-for-80-nights-with-only-240000-points/))

2. You do not receive status qualifying miles/nights to earn elite status on airlines or hotel chains (such as Marriott Platinum or Delta Gold). This can give you numerous benefits such as room and seat class upgrades.

3. If something goes wrong (i.e. airline or hotel loses your reservation), which happens OFTEN when booking though third parties, you will need to negotiate with the third party to fix the issue, instead of directly with the hotel or airline. This is a pain in the ass, and something like this could badly screw up your entire trip. Hotels and airlines always give priority to reservations made directly with them, since they didn't have to pay a commission fee to the third parties.

When accounting for the points/miles not earned, the rates on these third party sites are RARELY CHEAPER than booking directly, especially if you already have status with the hotel or airline you’re booking with.

——————————————————

So what’s wrong with chrome extensions like TravelArrow? They promise to save the customer money by redirecting them to these third party sites. The creators/owners of these extensions are paid by Kayak, Skyscanner, Priceline, etc. whenever you use the extension to redirect to their sites, because it gets their websites more clicks, which means there will be more people booking with them. They are essentially a platform for advertising these third party sites TO YOU.

I singled out TravelArrow specifically because they create extremely cringe and misleading TikToks to promote their extension. In [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRghg6nj/), they show that their extension found a flight on Skyscanner for $800 cheaper (lmao), but what they don’t mention is that the flight they found had TWO extra layovers and was 7+ hours longer.",48,147,TravelHacks

M 26 in Jordan from the US. I think it was a berry juice that I had on Monday. Woke up Tuesday to the liquid shits but honestly thought little of it. Went to play sports Wednesday night and then had to end it early because I was dizzy and ended up puking right after. I’ve had zero appetite until Thursday morning. Thought I was feeling slightly better, and went out with some friends for some tea at a cafe. Now it’s 3am and I have a flight in 9 hours and I’m still liquid on the toilet. 

Is it possible for me to take some pepto and survive the 12 hour flight or am I delusional? I really don’t want to rebook the entire flight it’s mad expensive :( 

Update 11AM: Woke up at 8 and puked a bit, honestly could’ve been half due to stressing. I don’t even have a local number so I couldn’t just call the airline from my hotel. We decided to go in person to try to upgrade seats at the very least. I found a pharmacy in the airport and just took the immodium dose (Ty everyone). It seems like I’m gonna have to suck it up for the next 12 hours. Wish me luck :)

Update Landed:

I fucking love you people. Took 2 immodium and drank one bottle of water before the flight. Decided to just not eat and barely drink (sips) for the first 6 hours, and then got quite hungry and ate a sandwich. Pooped about 7 times. Shockingly the worst part about the flight was how inconsiderate the passengers were. I had a child kicking my chair for 12 hours straight.

I'm getting married this year! Wooooo! And my wife-to-be and I together have decided that we want to have a traditional honeymoon. Where we go somewhere, do nothing, eat and drink a lot, because frankly, we haven't taken a vacation together since we began dating 5 years ago, and neither of us have taking any vacation since we were in high school. 

However we are having a hard time finding trips that aren't going to break our bank, and I'll be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing. We want to go right after the wedding, in the end of July, but August would also be cool. So maybe another time of year might be cheaper?

We will also be flying out of Canada. From what I've heard, Canada is stupid expensive to fly out of...but really it's our only choice. Toronto, London or maaaybe Montreal? Once again...never done this.

And maybe we shy away from the all inclusive Caribbean resorts? It seems like the easy option, but perhaps there's cheaper options? 

I'm looking for any and all tips and hacks that you use to travel for a fair price. Because what I'm seeing is....the complete opposite

Edit: I did not expect this to blow up to fast! We are both currently filtering through all of the great options. Our plan was to go for about 2 weeks, and we were planning to budget about $4,000 CAD for the whole trip. We are thinking Dominican, but open to anything!",161,141,TravelHacks

My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have been traveling for the past 148 days. Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a tight budget! We each have a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This is just one person's spend and we split basically everything.

I'd love to answer any questions about the budget/destinations/travel planning/etc. Any questions you may have feel free to ask or DM me.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100gb of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for at least half of the countries).

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas

Our original flight was from Boston to Detroit (3/4) with a final destination of Tokyo. We entered our passport info into the delta website and checked in, had the boarding passes in had. Due to weather in Boston we had to change our itinerary and fly through Atlanta.

Here is where everything gets a bit weird. I go to check us in but am being blocked with a message that we now need to check in at the airport - no biggie, happens from time to time. We show up and learn that our passports were reported stolen?!?! Delta could not check us in as our passports (that were in hand, along with other ID info) are of course no longer valid.

WTF! Our only option was to change the flight again to depart 3/7 evening with the hopes of getting an appointment tomorrow and a same day passport, which seems bleak.

Has anyone ever heard of something like this? Any advise?

Edit - Update! 

Thank you all for the responses and help here. Turns out that my fiancé's passport had been reported lost in May of 2019. We don't who did this, but remember that it had been misplaced during this time period and suspect a family member might have done this on her behalf. Since Covid happened shortly after this, she had no use for the passport and had no idea it was no longer valid. 

My passport on the other hand was completely fine to travel. Delta's system would not let me check in however until my fiancé's passport was valid.

Hoping that this subreddit can help me find the most frugal way to travel.

For an idea of my current plans and preferences:

1. Flying from the US (AUS), typically fly with Delta but I don't have a strong airline preference aside from not wanting to fly on Spirit/Allegiant/Frontier.

2. For accommodation, I would prefer a private room. I'm fine with shared bathrooms. Typically stay in hotels/AirBnBs during past travels, but I'm trying to gradually warm up to hostels for budget reasons!

3. During my travels, most interested in food (love all types of food, from street food to Michelin star cuisine. This is where I'm most wiling to splurge) and sightseeing (both nature and man-made). I don't like driving, so walkable places or places with strong public transportation/bus systems are a big plus!

4. No geographic restrictions. Quick note that I have been to quite a few of the main cities in the US in the last year (CHI/DC/BOS/NYC/DEN/DAL).

5. For current plans, I'm looking at a 1.5 - 2 week trip to all of Amsterdam/Copenhagen/Norway/Spain sometime in April.

12jl9ob,1681303912.0,Staying at the airport,Kkarotcake,"Hi! First time poster I have a flight that leaves at 6am and the drive to the airport is 2 hours, with respect for getting there on time (2 hours before departure) that puts me at 4 am which would mean leaving by 2 am. Since I would rather not do that nor leave my own car at the airport, and not pay for Uber. I was planning to have a friend drop us off at 11pm and then just stay overnight. It’s my first time doing this and I am looking for some tips! 

The airport is Atlanta-Hartsfield 

If I check a bag will I be checking it at 11pm or will I need to check it at a closer time to the flight?  

Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Based on comments it’s looking like the best plan will be to just drive and keep my car or get hotel nearby. I want to be cost effective so I think I’ll drive myself and leave my car. The trip is 11 days and I have never left my car at the airport and the thought makes me kinda nervous but what’s the best way to go about that?

Edit 2: so much helpful advice! I really appreciate the feedback. I’m thinking that roughing for 5 hours pre security really won’t be that difficult. I’m 23 I’ll survive an all-nighter. Park and stay would be more expensive and the shuttles don’t run at the time I’m looking for. Parking for 11 days costs as much as the hotel. I’ll nap before we leave and get there as late as possible.

Final edit! My amazing best friend is actually just gonna drive us down at around 2am, arrive at 4 am and check in like normal. So I’ll get to sleep in my own bed and also save $$$. Thanks for all the advice!",86,130,TravelHacks

My Schengen visa is valid from 24th March. If my flight arrives at 6 pm on 23rd March at night, can I stay at the airport for a couple of hours before entering the country/go through customs?

The airport would be Budapest Airport.

**Full story**: Initially I booked a ticket which would arrive on 24th March, but just now I received an email from the airline that the flight has been rescheduled to 22nd March.... I called them and they told me I could fly on the 23rd and land on the 23rd at 6 pm.

I've never been to Europe and lack international travel experience so I'm quite puzzled now....

Any advice would be helpful! Thank you.....

-----update------

So I called the airline and explained everything. They agreed to reschedule without a charge. I rescheduled. Great. Later on I found out that this flight costs at least double of the amount I paid for the original one.

I arrived at the airport, turned out the flight was oversold. They were offering around €550 if u would like to change to the next flight. I took the opportunity - they changed me to Air France. Great service.

I took the chance because my original flight would have arrived around 5 pm so I couldn't do much for the night anyway; the flight I actually took arrived at 7 am so I pretty much still have the full day to see the city. Plus put a bit money in my travel fund 😁.

So everything worked out perfectly.",56,133,TravelHacks

12hfd6e,1681124702.0,Help please - flying in a few hours and seated away from toddler,hitplayer,"We are currently on a trip to Tokyo with my toddler, and due to a family member falling critically ill, we had to cut short our trip and fly out on the next available flight. However, we did not manage to reserve seats together when changing our flights, and are now scattered. 

The worst part is that our 2-year old will have to sit alone - the bassinet seat, which is usually held back from being booked, has been taken. 

We have offered to pay to upgrade to business class or premium economy, but due to the sakura season, the flight is pretty full. 

We are dreading tantrums / meltdowns, and seriously no toddler should be flying alone without a guardian. We are not sure how the booking went through when there's a minor reflected, and only single seats are available. 

We are hoping to swap on board / hoping a seat frees up near him. Hoping to also bring along some extra Tokyo snacks as a big thank you for someone who can swap with us... Going to try going early to the check-in counter and boarding gate agent to beg for information re: allocation. Any tips on how to get seated next to our toddler within such a short time please? 

TIA!

Edit: Thanks everyone for your responses! Quick update - like many of you said, the check-in agent and boarding gate agent have the most visibility on seating, and the check-in agent was able to make changes so our toddler was not sitting alone. We headed to the airport about an hour earlier to explain the situation at the check-in counter, and it was quickly resolved.

Thankfully, it was not as dramatic as some of you had feared. There were some tour groups on the flight with bulk bookings, which also meant that there was flexibility within these groups to make changes, and I think that was where the check-in agent had focused. No drama on the plane, or at boarding. Everyone was happy as a clam, and the gifts we got (alcohol, snacks and make-up like some of you here suggested) became gifts on standby in case our toddler was having a bad time on the plane. 

The family member who was critically ill unfortunately passed away. To those wondering if we could have waited to take a different flight, no, unfortunately said family member only had days if not hours to live, and it was for us to rush back to say our final goodbyes.",186,128,TravelHacks

I know some people have “decoy wallets” that have expired cards in their back pocket so pickpockets take that instead of something actually valuable. 

It had me wondering why people don’t go out of their way to make the fake wallet more unpleasant. 
Maybe put in those music chips that are in fancy birthday cards, that blast sound when opened? Why not have the contents just be used tissues and loose glitter? Why not cover the exposed part of the wallet in a layer of Vaseline so it’s just generally gross to touch? If someone really wanted to, there should be a way to make a fake wallet that zaps you when you try to touch it…

I’m just surprised that people aren’t out there eager to annoy the crap out of a random pickpocket. I’ve never experienced it so maybe I’m too naive, or it’s just unrealistic? I just know that some people prepare “fake packages” for porch pirates, or find creative ways to piss off scammers. Why not pickpocketers?

1f212ue,1724711039.0,Hack- always take photos          Visa lost - My nightmare experience with Qatar airlines,Constant-Ad4248,"Hello Reddit,

I wanted to share a frustrating and stressful experience I recently had while flying with Qatar Airways. I hope this post raises awareness and helps others avoid similar situations.

Background:

I was on a Qatar Airways flight from San Francisco to Doha with a connecting flight to Hyderabad. There was a delay in the flight due to a passenger losing conscious ness in air so we jaded to do emergency landing in Kuwait which took like an hour and 40 minutes. There was a connecting lfight from doha to Hyderabad in 2 hours which flew off as we landed in doha


The Incident:

Things took a turn for the worse during the layover in Doha. An airline representative, who was Tunisian and responsible for handling flights from Doha to Hyderabad, basically started randomly and CARELESSLY collecting passports and OCI from all passengers and many were reluctant to give, he said it was on him to make sure everyone got theirs back. He took my OCI and my passport too. The reason being he was either gonna get us a flight in the next 6 hours or gonna get us hotel rooms if not possible.

Before handing over my OCI card, I asked 2-3 times why they needed it, especially since the passport should have sufficed.He said  insisted they “just need it,” and also said that me being speculative was just delaying everyone else from being processed. So all of us sat in chairs for 2 hours and he went in the room with about 30 passports or so. He was basically coming every ten minutes with 5-6 passports and giving them away and telling them if they got hotel or flight. I was the last one to get my passport back. 

He finally came out with my new boarding pass and my US passport, but no OCI, then he told him to recheck and he went back in and claimed there is no OCI in there. He then told me i NEVER gave him my OCI. There was nobody left since i was the last one to receive mine so nobody could attest to me giving him the OCI. 

Then he told me i must have lost it somewhere on my way to Doha airport or that i was so tired from the flight i must be hallucinating so he told me check my RFID proof play uch if it had something in it. I checked it and there nothing except for my US passport and boarding pass. 

At this moment, the whole floor knew my OCI was missing and now is telling me i mist have forgotten it at home. At this point, im trying to remain calm and answer his stupid allegations as to what could have happened, it was like proving the dog did not eat it. Luckily i had photos of me i took to send to my family in which i was holding my oci and passport.  

This Tunisian idiot is now going around to all people going to Hyderabad and asking them if they have an oci that is not theirs. He was introducing me as “ this person lost their OCI we want to confirm “ it didnt end up in your bag. 

I mean, wtf, you ( Tunisian) distributed the passport and OCI, i didn’t.

Then i told him to write me a letter of apology stating he lost my OCI because that was the only thing i could NOW show to Indian government to let me in. He said he cant because its not his fault that I LOST it. 

Finally, as we were walking around arguing, i see an OcI in the hands of another colleague of his, and i ask her to show it to me ….. its MY OCI. 

He also takes a look and asks where she got it from, she says he was also in the room working with him and was trying to find me. 

Keep in mind, this incident has been going on for  more than 30 minutes . What kind of an idiot will search the entire floor full of at least 300 people for one person. Any reasonable person would have made an announcement calling my name to the front desk. 

At the end he apologized for the mistake but said it was technically not his fault since he was organized but was his coworkers fault for grabbing his side of the passports. 

So now, i was relieved so i went to freshen up and came back and asked for the Tunisian dude. That guy has vanished, when i describe the appearance of this guy to them, they recall him, but don’t recall anyone arguing with him. Everybody is trying to cover for him so i don’t file a complaint against him. I also noted that, when i Oci first got lost, he went in to search for it again but he took out his iD card from his shirt so i don’t file a complaint. I was in so much stress i totally forgot to note his name down. 

But anyways, i was able to go to india without any further nightmares. 


Advice:

Whenever you hand over your passports, visas, or any important documents, take a photo of them and of the person receiving them. This can serve as proof of what was given and to whom, which might help in case of similar issues. It’s a small precaution that could save you a lot of stress and trouble.

Has anyone else faced similar issues with Qatar Airways or other airlines? How did you handle it? Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading.


Edit: 

I see many comments saying why i keep saying Tunisian dude, and they say that by doing this, im just stereotyping them.  

I’m NOT  blaming Tunisian guy because he is Tunisian or something, its just that on a floor full of Indians and Chinese and African Americans, he was the only guy that was from Tunisia. Plus that is the only thing that i factually know about him. I might be coming out as a racist, but i have no intention to target a specific community whatsoever.",30,129,TravelHacks
15umq71,1692370389.0,APPRECIATION POST: thank you for getting me to AZ safely.,DuckReporting,"I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/15rta0w/friend_bought_me_a_train_ticket_and_im_about_to/) the other day when I was on my way to Arizona from South Carolina. I had just lost my job and was going to be facing homelessness in a few weeks. A friend in the Phoenix area offered me a train ticket and a place to stay with her until I got on my feet and took her up on it.

I wound up making it to DC and my dog was getting sick and throwing up, but she started to do better, so we made it to our next stop in Chicago where we were told that she couldn’t continue on Amtrak any longer, as she was too much of a disruption. I was worried sick about her too.

A wonderful couple of people here pulled together and helped me with food for me and her and helped us get from Chicago to AZ early this morning.

It’s something I’ll never forget and I will definitely be paying it forward once I find a job and get on my feet. I’ll be enrolling at a community college here and getting out of the restaurant industry asap.

Some tips if you ever find yourself in my situation:

- forget your pride. Everyone goes through it at some point.
- be wary of talking to strangers irl or sharing too much about being vulnerable. Almost got into a sticky situation with someone who tried to take advantage of my plight.
- eat. Even if you think it’s a waste of what little you may have, if you don’t eat, you can’t think straight.
- keep a positive attitude, no matter what.

Thanks again to everyone.  I’m going to go apply for food and clothing assistance as soon as the office opens, but if anyone here happens to live near the Tempe area and has extra clothes, I desperately need some. I’m a size small-medium and wear a size 7 shoe.

Brief:

- I'm an African male and I'll be travelling solo
- Return ticket budget: $800-$1400
- I want to stay for at least 10 days and up to 14 days
- The ultimate plan is to visit USA for the World Cup but this trip will be like a pre-tour of USA so I want to enjoy the country before the WC fever gets in and everything changes
- But I have no clue on the budget to spend per day (I'm leaning on the conservative side of things)
- I don't mind staying in lodges or AirBNB
- I plan on having max. 2 meals a day, I don't eat too much
- Options: man-made tourist features e.g. music events, parks, clubs etc OR natural tourist features: rivers, mountains, canyons OR a mixture of both? 🤔
- I dont mind road trips, trains, ferries etc

So I guess, my questions are:

1. When is it best to visit?
2. How many states/cities should I go to?
3. Which destinations would you recommend to an international tourist that wants to explore as much as possible within 2 weeks?
4. How much should I save per day for food, accommodation and transport?
5. What's more feasible: state to state visits, city to city, or choosing just one or two cities and sticking to them?
6. Feel free to add anything else that could help

Started out in Will Rogers (which is pretty small compared to other major city airports) and it took ~5 minutes to get from the beginning of the clear line to grabbing our bags off the luggage belt and walking away to get to our gate. Next airport was on our return flight out of MCO on Labor Day. Showed up at around 5:15 am for a 8:00 am departure. Regular TSA and precheck lines were both packed, so I was starting to think there’s no way we’re getting through this without AT LEAST an hour wait. Nope, not even close. 

We walked up to the clear lane, got fingerprinted, escorted over to the front of the precheck line and were able go right to putting our bags on the line to get through the metal detector. All of it took ~5-6 mins in total. We were able to head over to a different terminal to grab some breakfast and hang in the lounge for a few hours before catching our flight back home, which was great considering how early it was. 

So, if you don’t have the precheck + clear combo, I 100% recommend getting it. It makes getting through airport security significantly less stressful and gives you a lot more time to do other things before your flight.",106,121,TravelHacks

Wikivoyage: [https://www.wikivoyage.org/](https://www.wikivoyage.org/) My personal favorite and also one of my most used. A lot of useful info for everything you need to know about getting to/from/inside of a new country. As well as a few recommendations for things to try.

Organic Maps: This map app is based on OpenStreetMaps and is a fork from [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) If you didn't know [maps.me](https://maps.me/) was purchased by a payment company and since has become bloated and the philosophy seems to have changed. Organic Maps goes back to what made [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) so amazing in the first place. Download maps for offline use, pin and categorize things you see/visit, and is very lightweight.

HiChee: [https://hichee.com/](https://hichee.com/) Check if the Airbnb or [booking.com](https://booking.com/) listing you are interested in is listed on another platform. It shows the price on all available platforms and can save you some money! I just recently discovered this and have already saved a bit of money!

18xy83t,1704325999.0,Sharing my Experience Getting Scammed by Budget Car Rental,rimrimpimpim,"Hi - I recently had an issue with Budget wherein they tried to scam me out of money for damage done to the vehicle before I rented it. I figured I’d share my experience, how I successfully fought back, and how I recommend consumers protect themselves when renting cars. 

Through my Costco account, I rented a car from Budget at LAX while visiting California a couple of months ago. It was covered in scratches when I received it, and I returned it in the exact same condition three days later. Two months later, I was sent a bill for nearly a thousand dollars. I suspect that when they find damage, they wait for someone to rent the vehicle who doesn’t buy the supplemental insurance and try to pin it on them. 

The dispute process was awful - they were extremely dismissive and condescending towards me, and it became clear fairly quickly that they had no desire to take me seriously. Unfortunately for them, I had an ace up my sleeve:

Before I left the lot with the car, I took pictures of the entire outside and inside of my car with my iPhone. I made sure all damage was clearly visible on said photos. Most people don’t do this, which is what these companies are counting on. 

When I got the bill, the first thing I did was demand all documentation relating to the damage - an inspection report, photos, and an itemized list of said damage and what it cost to repair it. They eventually sent this, and all damage in the photos was visible in the ones I took. So I sent them said photos, and they tried to pull a “We aren’t calling you a liar, but you can’t prove when and where these photos were taken, so we have to go with the facts at hand…”

Which is of course nonsense. So I sent them the metadata from said photos, proving they were taken about two minutes after they handed me the keys, and with location data proving it was taken in their parking lot. I also included a version history of said photos, proving that none of the data was tampered with. I told them that I expected a prompt response or that I would consider this matter closed. I was told to “wait while the dispute resolution team can verify these photos.”

This was near the holidays, so I figured this could take some time. I was pretty furious and frustrated at this point, so I registered a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Mind you, they can’t really enforce anything but they do command a lot of respect. The LAX location has a LOT of complaints on the BBB website, so I honestly figured it was for naught. 

But, a week or so later, I got a message from Budget via the BBB stating that my photos do in fact prove that the damage was there before I received the car, and they attached a letter from Sedgwick (one of the companies they hire to do damage claims) that they rescinded the bill. 

I would HIGHLY recommend that anyone who rents a car perform EXTENSIVE photo documentation, both before you leave the lot and after you return it. It takes maybe two minutes tops and is among the only things you can do to combat these false and surprisingly common allegations. If they try to automatically bill your credit card, dispute it - your insurance company and your credit card providers are aware of these scams and will fight for you, but having photo and video evidence will make it clear much earlier on that you’re in the right.

Anyone else have a similar story? How did you fight the allegations?",99,122,TravelHacks

12if2ka,1681207652.0,A few hacks for Athens,torbatosecco,"Just back from Athens, so I guess I'd share a few hacks.

The Get Your Guide combo ticket for 5 historycal sites is very popular and it's 100% worth it, just do not buy it online. This combo ticket is sold at any of the 5 sites and it costs 30€ instead of the 36€ on GYG. Here the hack is: head to some of the less popular sites, like the Roman Agora or the Acient Agora. No lines there, buy it straight away and go to the Acropolis. Basically avoid going to the Acropolis first because there is where huge lines are. Only after you have your ticket bought elsewhere, go to the Acropolis entrance. Bonus point: young under 25 (if EU citizens) enter for free but they need to hold their tickets and you can't get these free tickets on GYG, so for example at the Acropolis you have to line up at the ticket office even if you have got your GYG Adult tickets.

From Airport to downtown and back Metro is your friend. Unfortunately there is no way to buy a reduced fare ticket at the ticketing machines, so if you travel with children you are out of luck and you maybe have to pay the full fare (9€) anyhow.
Maybe getting the rechargable card would work but I am not sure as I did not buy it.

The ""withlocals"" Athens tour are really worth it. I recommend doing the less touristy tour.",15,120,TravelHacks

1fsbcdv,1727635049.0,Just had a timeshare pitch and it went pretty well! (I didn’t buy the time share),NeonUFO,"A couple of months ago, me and my then fiance, now wife, signed up for a couple “sweepstakes” at a wedding convention. My mom who was with us at the time suspected they were timeshare pitches, and they were. She warned us about how NOT to get them because of their resale value. After looking up a few articles and personal experiences with the pitches, i had a plan going in and it went alot better than expected.

First off, i asked the salesman how long the presentation was and he said “90 minutes” which i then responded “ok perfect because we need to pick up my elderly grandmother in 2 hours”. Im not sure how much this affected how fast he went through with it, but i feel like it gave the salesman a bit more urgency. Ive heard of these pitches going for much longer than what was told, but we stayed an hour and 40 minutes, so not bad.

Another thing I did was i lied about our financial situation and showed them i was a terrible client. I lied that we were low on funds, we didnt vacation much, and worked low end jobs to make ends meet on expensive rent. Im sure this discouraged the sales person alot, and i could tell in his face and his tone of voice after relaying this information multiple times. 

Me and my wife were prepared for compliments on anything we told him about us (which wasnt much truth btw), a bunch of agreeing with our opinions to flatter us, and cherry picking/sugarcoating prices, stats and whatever else the salesperson was pitching to us and to take everything either with a grain of salt or as a complete lie.

after the whole pitch and the tour of the condo, we got back to our table and he got the second person who was alot more quiet and gentle which was a nice surprise. he stayed for two minutes after giving us another discount (we were also expecting this). After we declined citing financial issues and lack of enthusiasm to go on vacation he shook our hand and left.

The closing guy was the worst one… not pushy, but just a nutjob. he told us “i only give this packages to vips and shareholders” and gave us this 1 time deal of 12,500 for a condo or something, i wasnt really paying attention. we declined again for the same reasons and they got us out in 1 hour, 40 instead of the promised 90 minutes.

I was expecting alot worse with rude and extremely pushy sales people but i think our lie of financial issues and lack of interest vacationing really lowered their expectations of us buying. We told them this really early on in the presentation also. We were not rude to any of the sales people either, being very polite and conversating with the main salesman in which i liked his taste of music and we shared a small conversation of our favourite bands. This small talk probably prevented them from being rude to us when we ultimately declined the offer. 

So we got a free $150, our $129 deposit back on the same debit card and a “free” 3 day, 2 night stay at an orlando hotel which im sure there will be some charge with tax but at least it will be like a heavily discounted room! :)",85,117,TravelHacks

I've tried searching this on Google and reddit and most of the time I'm trying to search flights they're all coming back easily £1,500 for a return Dec23-Jan24 to visit my partner of 4 years and their family for Christmas.

I've primarily had my flights arranged through work when i was briefly working there, so havent had any real experience booking flights for myself.

I've been unlucky with work these past few months and my commission but have been a bit more fortunate lately. I know there will be cheaper flights out there or methods to finding them. I'm just having difficulty figuring out which 3rd parties can be legit and how I can figure this out myself.

I couldn't afford it a couple months ago at £900 and don't want to pay almost double now due to my poor circumstances. I'm just hoping to find someone who is a lot more travel savvy than me, who can even just help guide me in the right direction!

EDIT: Resolved! I just spent hours playing around with different dates and the websites everyone recommended!

In the end I settled for booking with Emirates from 18th December - 19th January for £1300 and ended up using a 10% rebate in top of that, after signing up for the CompleteSavings rewards alongside my Iceland shop haha.

1 layover is enough for me, I don't want the hassle of paying extra baggage fees and manually transferring in each location either through multiple airlines.

1ej5n0e,1722697919.0,Super.com WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!,Recent-Winner9496,"I recently had the worst experience ever with Super.com that I feel compelled to share as a warning to potential users.

I booked a room through their app well in advance, got charged and received a confirmation email assuring me that my reservation was secured. However, after my flight got canceled and I finally arrived at the hotel at 3 a.m. after a long day of travel, I was told there were no rooms available and there was no reservation under my name. The hotel staff confirmed they had not received any booking from Super.com. Even though, Super.com had already charged me for a reservation spanning multiple nights.

Attempting to resolve this, I reached out to Super.com’s customer service, which only offers support through chat (Delaying even further the time for any kind of resolution) This only escalated my frustration. The representative I chatted with was unhelpful and dismissive, offering no clear solutions or alternatives. Despite being transferred between multiple agents and enduring lengthy waits, it took more than two hours to review my case, and I was left stranded with no accommodation for the weekend.

Super.com’s incompetence and lack of accountability are astonishing. Not only did they fail to secure the promised reservation, but their customer service also showed a complete disregard for my situation. This experience caused significant inconvenience and stress, forcing me to scramble for and pay for another hotel at the last minute.

I would strongly advice never using Super.com, unless you want to have your family spend a night in the street (like mine had to) and your vacation ruined because of their incompetence and lack of accountability.",119,112,TravelHacks

It can last for days after I fly. What suggestions or hacks do you use to prevent this? 

I’ve tried gas-x and 600mg ibuprofen. I get massages and soak in the tub when I land but it still takes awhile to bounce back.

I’m packing an ice mask for my upcoming trip next week to see if that will help. 

I want to look good on this trip. Not extremely bloated and puffy from my flight. Any recommendations will be appreciated!

Edit: Thank you all so much for your responses! I didn’t expect this post to blow up so much. I’ve been reading through them all each night. 

I decided to try intermittent fasting this week & I’ve come to find that my gas and bloating IS in fact caused by food as many of you have suggested. I have yet to figure out which foods are causing it- but each day that I break my fast I blow up and get extremely gassy almost immediately. I’m going to slowly tapper off my fast starting tomorrow and completely avoid high FODMAP food. I also purchased simethicine 500mg as suggested as well as plan to avoid any food or bubbly beverages day of travel & will take that with some tums.

14fd02p,1687366417.0,Travel Hacks after Two Weeks in the Mid-East,BuckeyeMark,"This group helped me considerably so I'll try to pay it forward a little with a few hacks that helped me on my latest trip:

**Cargo pants are amazing** \- who cares what the fashionistas say?  You need pockets when you travel and pockets on the side of your pants by your knees are great for accessing stuff when you're sitting down, like on an airplane or bus.

**Compressed towels** \- we bought these on Amazon.  They look like over-sized aspirins but when you hit them with a little water they ""inflate"" and become full-sized hand towels.  Disposable - one use kind of thing. Amazing and wonderful.  There can be a lack of TP in bathrooms and these are the solution. Also, a poor lady got sick on a bus and was a mess - presto, we had towels to help her clean up.

EDIT: here's the link to what we bought: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WHFPKLY/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WHFPKLY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

**Purell wipes** \- better than carrying hand sanitizer.

**White noise machine** \- we have a really small rechargeable one and it's a blessing. Apparently someone posted a sign outside our hotel that said PLEASE SOUND YOUR SIREN REPEATEDLY RIGHT HERE but we slept anyway.  


EDIT: here's our machine - we like having a dedicated WN maker instead of using our phones:  
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ML45FCQ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1  


**IV water supplement**  \- bought these at Costco and they were tremendous. Hot days hiking and touring are rough. Pour one of these in a water bottle, shake, and your body is refreshed.  Just a game changer.

Two more ideas: **don't buy any case/pouch in the color black** . I have a Kindle cover and several other items like glasses cases that I've bought in black or dark grey because it looks good. And it does ... until you try to find it in the bottom of your backpack! Go with bright colors -easier to find.

And ... **bring an extra pair of prescription glasses.** Wife had an accident w/her glasses and we'd have been delayed trying to get them repaired (or she simply could have seen nothing on our trip).  Instead she put on a spare pair and off we went.

Hope these help you have a great trip!",33,110,TravelHacks

zxoqun,1672270289.0,Learning from the mistakes and misfortunes of others,vagimite2000,"I re3cently suffered a travel mishap which was not my fault at all. This was right before the big holiday air travel meltdown in which travelers are still trying to dig their way out of.

Here are a few things I have learned from both experience and observation:

1. Buy travel- insurance Do not expect your accommodation to pick up the tab and fully refund you because of an airline issue. The hotel/airbnb host has nothing to do with the fact that your flight was cancelled. In this day and age of Covid and everything else, it makes zero sense to not pay a little extra for insurance.
2. Know your rights- Understand what your rights are as a passenger, and when things go pear shaped, stand up for those rights! Don't need to be a Karen Supreme, but don't let them get away with shortchanging you.
3. Be kind- During our air travel mishap which we were diverted to a tiny, closed airport with no amenities overnight, we were waiting for ground crew to set up the jet bridge so we could deplane. During this time, the pilot came out of the cockpit and answered passengers' questions. A couple of men in their 60s aggressively questioned the pilot. ""You said we had to land here because of freezing fog! Are you trying to tell me you couldn't see Rapid City from the plane? I was looking out the window and saw it just fine!"" he calmly answered that while yes, you could see the airport, had we descended through the freezing fog, the fog would create a layer of ice on the plane, and he would not be able to control the plane very well. These older men continued their line of aggressive questioning until they opened the aircraft door. They were trying to make the poor pilot look stupid, but the rest of us understood that he was trying to keep us safe. Being a dick does no one any good, and everyone harm.
4. Always keep a change of clothes, especially underwear, in your carry on! Luckily, we were only held less than 24 hours, but some people are spending 2 and 3 days in the airport.
5. Keep any medications, at least 3 days worth, in your carry on with you! If you need to gate check you carry on, take out your meds, and keep them with you.
6. If you have dietary restrictions, keep some food with you. I made the mistake of not eating a meal in the airport when I had the chance. I figured I would be home in a few hours, and I could wait to eat. Little did I know, our flight would be first delayed a couple of hours, and then diverted to a closed airport with a single vending machine. Nope, there was nothing in the vending machine I could eat, and I didn't have any more snacks in my bag. While I wasn't in any health danger from missing a meal, I was certainly uncomfortable and hangry.
7. Take the deal if it's offered. We were offered $520 plus hotel accommodation, plus transportation to and from the hotel, plus a meal voucher if we would have taken the next flight, which was the next day. We considered it, but were afraid the same thing would happen the next day. I wish we had taken the deal. Sleeping in a hotel bed is superior to getting an hour of sleep on the cold floor of the airport.
8. Be patient. I know it's incredibly frustrating, but anyone who is working in the airport does not make the rules. Your fellow passengers are, like you, doing the best they can.",17,108,TravelHacks

1g74zd5,1729329067.0,Saving money on United by making a Multi-City Booking for a Skiplagged Flight.,Snowjunkie21,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a fun flight hack I found while booking a trip from Seoul (ICN) to Denver (DEN) this week. The direct flight on United (ICN to SFO to DEN) is $843, but I found a way to get that same flight for only $389 – and I get to check a free bag without technically “skiplagging”!

Here’s how I did it:

Instead of booking the ICN to DEN flight directly, I found a cheaper ticket for the same route that continues on to Philadelphia (PHL). Normally, you’d skip the last leg to avoid extra travel, but United might penalize you for this. So, I booked a multi-city trip and pushed the DEN to PHL leg way into the future – to September 2025. By doing this, I got the exact same flights from ICN to DEN but at the much lower $389 price, and since the last leg is so far away, I won’t have to worry about taking it!

Here’s the breakdown of the flights:

Flight 1: ICN to SFO
Fri, Oct 25
4:50 PM ICN → 11:45 AM SFO
(Nonstop, 10hr 55min)

Flight 2: SFO to DEN
Fri, Oct 25
5:45 PM SFO → 9:23 PM DEN
(Nonstop, 2hr 38min)

Flight 3: DEN to PHL
Thu, Sep 4, 2025
6:30 AM DEN → 1:51 PM PHL
(1 stop, 5hr 21min)

Bonus tip: I’m hoping for a schedule change on that September 2025 leg so I can get some credit back!

Hope this helps someone else snag some cheaper flights. Happy travels! ✈️",40,106,TravelHacks

Are They Overpriced?,MussleGeeYem,"I (24M) visited both and paid 60 euros for the combined ticket (30 for the Galata and another 30 for the Maiden's Tower after a 2 euro discount), and based on my experiences, they seem extortionately overpriced. In 2018, those would have costed 25 lira each, or about 5 euros or even less, depending on what month you visited.

First off, I have visited the Galata Tower in Beyoglu. I climbed the Kamondo stairs in order to get to the Galata Tower. Even though it was first built in 528 during Justinian's rule, the Crusaders destroyed the Galata Tower and rebuilt it in its current form in 1349 in the Romanesque style. Uponing entering, I entered the lift, which would take me to the 6th floor, and then I made the ascent to the 7th floor. In the 7th floor, you are greeted with a model of Istanbul and in the 8th floor, you are greeted with the observation deck.

Once you descend into the 5th floor, you are greeted to some artefacts from the Neolithic, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and early Ottoman eras, and in the 4th floor, you are treated with more artefacts. In the 3rd floor, it depicts some 16th century astronomers, and the 2nd floor is where the Galata tower gallery is. The 1st floor is where the gift shop is. Overall, there is quite little content for 30 euros.

On the next day, I visited the Maiden's Tower on the Bosphorous. I took a metro all the way to the Karakoy Pier, and there, I started taking a ferry to the Maiden's Tower (which is a nice quirk), and the Maiden's Tower is extremely spartan. There are only three museum wall texts, depicting the history of the Maiden Tower, legend, and renovations/repairs, in both Turkish and Englishh. You do find three Cannon mortars and an observation deck where you could see the European and Asian side of Istanbul, but apart from the boat ride, the museum is very spartan. After 30 minutes, I headed to Uskudar and enjoyed the Asian side of Istanbul.

Even though some tourist attractions in Istanbul are extremely expensive, every single religious site (except the Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, and Kariye Mosque) are free. Both the Egyptian bazaar and Grand bazaar are free to enter as well. Even though some restaurants charge upwards of 600 TL, I could find full meals like the Adana kebab and chicken and rice for as low as 200-250 TL (5-6.50 EUR). A 500 mL bottle of water costs 10 TL on average (about 0.25 EUR) and I found water that costs as less as 4 TL. Hotels are quite affordable as well. I booked a 5-star Holiday Inn Hotel in Fatih last minute for 55 USD a night and I found Hotel Orkide, which is a Russian owned hotel with a single bed, private restroom, AC, and Wi-Fi for 20 USD a night.

The reasons why I believe the Galata/Maiden's Tower are overpriced for foreigners is because:

During the low season, the entire Palais de Versailles + the gardens only cost 21 EUR

The Eiffel Tower costs 14.50 EUR for adults for the least expensive fare (2nd floor via stairs) and 23.10 EUR for adults for the 2nd floor via lift. The most expensive ticket is 36.10 EUR for the top. Even though I graduated from uni with a CS degree in 2022, I will turn 24 in September 2025, rendering me as ""qualifying"" for the student ticket, which could slash the prices by half.

The Louvre costs 22 EUR

The Colloseum costs 18 EUR

The Acropolis complex in Athens costs 20 EUR

The Topology of Terror in Berlin is free

The British Museum is free

The Smithsonian Museums are free

The Statue of Liberty costs 33 USD (about 30 EUR)

The Thang Long Citadel in Hanoi only costs 100k VND (about 3.60 EUR)

The Imperial City of Hue costs 200k VND (about 7.20 EUR)

The Independence Palace + Norodom Palace exhibition in HCMC costs 65000 VND (about 2.30 EUR)

1jcjt01,1742126049.0,TSA PreCheck and Kids,IraGilliganTax,"I searched the forum and didn't see anyone talking about this.

My daughter and I are flying in a few weeks. She is 13, so she has just missed the cutoff for going through the TSA PreCheck lane with me without the TSA PreCheck logo being on her boarding pass. [https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/do-children-need-apply-tsa-precheckr](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/do-children-need-apply-tsa-precheckr)

Does anyone here have experience with this? I'm curious how strictly it is enforced. It seems it would depend on if we got stopped when entering the line by the person who quickly looks at your boarding pass, and whether or not I would have to prove her age. She looks older, so I think it's likely we would get stopped. I had to read that link 3 times before I understood what they were saying (under 12, they can go with me even if they don't have the logo on their boarding pass, 13-17 they need it on their boarding pass), so can I just ask AA to put it on her boarding pass since she's between 13-17? Obviously I'm going to call and ask, but I was posting here to get a feel for other experiences.

I don't mind getting her TSA PreCheck, but we wouldn't get it in time for this trip, and I'd really like the time cushion of using TSA PreCheck on this particular trip because it's spring break so the airport will be crazy, and we are taking a shuttle to the airport so I don't have complete control over what time we arrive.",28,0,TravelHacks

Last summer my boyfriend was visiting me from Italy and we rented a car from Panek to travel in Lithuania. A few days after he returned the car, they took 800 euros and then 400 euros from his credit card. I tried calling them here but they said their phone number works for road assistance only, when we sent them an email they claimed they hadn't taken any money, then later they said it was for speeding and breaking something (we returned the car in the same conditions as it was before).

Eventually, my boyfriend went to his bank in Italy, reported the charges as fraudulent, got his credit card blocked and got his money back. He has also made a report at the police.

After that, Panek transferred his case to debt collectors in Lithuania, who started sending him emails and calling asking to pay, and now they gave his data to Italian debt collectors, who are now constantly calling him.

After all this happened, we read reviews online and know that Panek is basically a scam.

For cold-sensitive people, better to wear 3-4 layers—including a down vest. If you have a light and moisture resistant clothing, it won’t be stuffy but you’ll still have good insulation. 

For hot-warm-sensitive people (more like me), 2-3 layers—with or without vest.  Personally, I like having a balance with cool lower body and warm on the upper! 

② For the lower body, at least 1-2 layers: a fleece-lined pants and a heat tech leggings is enough 👖 . Adding knee-high fleece socks OR knee-to-ankle-warmers are great options too. I prefer this more for flexibility. If the weather becomes sunny and warm, taking it off won’t be difficult.

③ Wear waterproof comfortable shoes. For snow, Boa-lined boots would be perfect. 

④ Scarf 🧣 and ear mufflers are both functional and aesthetic. It’s removable at any time and lightweight so when the weather cools down or heats up, just use when needed. Plus points when it also improves the getup’s overall appearance! 

Note: Insulation depends on the quality of the fabric and not just the number of layers. ",11,1,TravelHacks

1jb0jki,1741947142.0,Cheap flight alerts for a specific destination but flexible dates?,cloink,"I'm looking for a tool or website, but cannot find it as most of them only do a part of what I'm looking for. Does it simply not exist?

So, my requirements would be:

* Departure from multiple specific airports (3 at most, as I'm willing to drive a little if the difference is in cost is large enough). This one isn't a deal-breaker, willing to subscribe to 3 routes/alerts.
* Destination is fixed (one airport)
* Dates are flexible, but limited in flexibility (departure should be between 2 specific dates)
* Stay duration is flexible, but limited in flexibility (should be between 13 to 16 days)

The ""classic"" options (Google Flights, Skyscanner, Momondo/Kayak, etc.) all do something in the neighborhood, but as far as alerts go, they do it for a specific route (which would be too limiting, as I would need to subscribe to tens or even hundreds of routes/dates).

Then I looked at AI tools and the closest to what I want is [https://avionero.com/](https://avionero.com/) as their search does exactly what I want (except for the multiple departure options, but as I said can circumvent that with 3 separate searches). But they don't have alerts/notifications. :( So would need to check that manually, on a daily basis or something.

Others I already looked at:

* [https://www.imean.ai](https://www.imean.ai) which keeps serving me hits from Cheapoflights, which turn out to be wrong fares (220 EUR reported and if I click through to Cheapoflights, it changes it into 790 EUR...) and also doesn't seem to have notifications/alerts?
* [https://www.eddytravels.com](https://www.eddytravels.com) which is far too limited, seems like a very limited chatbot without too many AI possibilities

I'll be visiting for 5 days (arrive on the Friday - leave on the Tuesday), flying into Podgorica, staying in Perast, and will be exploring the neighbouring towns around the Bay of Kotor.

Ideally looking for 2 SIMs, for me and my partner, with about 5GB on each for the best price possible with One or Telekom (as read they're the better providers).

I've seen online the €15 for 500GB tourist eSIMs (offered by One, Telekom, and Mtel), as well as all the non-local companies e.g. Airalo, Saily etc. that offer similar price, if not more, for just a few GB.

500GB is insane overkill for my needs, and I imagine comes with a daily cap anyway.

I did come across a website called ByteSim that offered MTEL 5GB for £6/€7 and 10GB for £9/€11, which seems like the best option, but I've read that MTEL can be quite rubbish.

Are there any eSIM options available to me that offers <10GB, but is also cheaper and more suited for short stay?

If so, can this be found on the more reliable network providers (e.g. One, Telekom)?

If not, can physical SIMs be found at shops/kiosks in Podgorica for less than what's advertised online?

* booked a work travel trip Saturday for Tues - Thurs of the following week - 2 nights at a Hilton - to NYC for \~$600. 
* Found Hotel on Google. Chose Super . com rate of the options, as it was a significant discount from the Hilton rate and I thought I would be a responsible corporate citizen (last time)
* **Chose and Purchased the $58 ""Extended Refundable"" option** as the work travel plans tend to shift around 
* Work plans did not shift, but had an illness in my family that cropped up Sunday, which rendered me unable to travel
* Reviewed confirmation and followed path to kick off Refund --> took me to 3rd party site Refundable . me
* This is where the shenanigans began - it was imminently NOT straightforward to request a refund - full multi-page application required - and when I selected 'illness' as the reason for the refund, an attachment request popped up for me to attach a \*required\* doctor's note... 
* Further down the page, there was a bug on the page and I couldn't choose ANY method to receive my refund
* I thus reached out to Refundable . me to inquire about how best to receive my refund, and got the following response:

*Hi Benjamin,*

*Thank you for your response.*

*Please understand that the service you purchased and agreed to is an extension of your basic terms, providing additional reasons under which you may apply for a refund. However, in order for us to review your application and for you to meet the eligibility criteria, we require the evidence that we have previously requested from you.*

*Our terms and refund eligibility criteria are clearly outlined for review before purchasing the service. I’m sorry if there was any misunderstanding, but we have the right to decline refund applications that do not meet these terms.*

*At this time, we are unable to proceed further. However, if you would like your application to be re-opened, please let me know. We’d be happy to discuss the evidence requirements with you again.* ***Please note that for illness-related refund requests, our terms require a medical note dated prior to the date of the booking. Refunds cannot be approved if no physical examination took place before the booking date.***

*Please let us know how you’d like to proceed.*

*Kind regards,*

*Mary*

*Customer Experience Supervisor*



**Holy smokes! Yes! You read that right! If the illness occurred AFTER the booking date, THEY WONT REFUND FOR ILLNESS. This term essentially makes the 'illness' stipulation completely worthless - why would I book a trip if there was an illness that would make me unable to travel?** 

**I even went and got a doctor's note, shared it, and shared proof of relationship - they are still refusing to provide my full refund.** 

Right now I am out \~$600 and you can bet I am going to battle to get my money back...

I've traveled extensively in Europe and Asia on budget/airbnb holidays, but for some reason I am totally lost with looking at Caribbean/Central America! I'm finding it hard to get a handle on the different islands and countries without going for an all inclusive resort (something we aren't really interested in).

What we're looking for:

\- decent flight connection from JFK/Newark

\- good food, specifically local cuisine!

\- the classic white beach/blue water combo (I'd love to see some fish while snorkeling!)

\- non-beachy activity options-- nature hikes, cultural locations, etc. Would prefer a place with interesting local milieu/culture

\- not horrifically sweltering hot in late June, if possible

\- easy on a budget, someplace that won't break the bank!

Locations that have caught our eye so far: Curacao, Barbados, St. Lucia, possibly Puerto Rico/USVI?

I've mostly been looking at Caribbean islands, but I am also very open to recommendations for Latin American countries that might fit the bill!",1,2,TravelHacks

I have no official records on hand that I know of that would be able to verify the correct spelling of my mom’s last name. 

I would prefer not to contact her (I’ve been estranged from her for fifteen years) but from what I’m reading online, I may need her to verify her last name with the county clerk who issued the birth certificate where I was born. 

This isn’t convenient because I’m not close to where I was born and neither is my mom. If she and I need to be in person, it’ll be a real pain. 

It’s not safe to contact her but I have no idea how else I’m going to get a passport with her last name on my birth certificate spelled wrong. 

**Is there a way for me to correct her last name on my birth certificate without her?**

*To reduce any complications with processing, I’m wondering if it’s best I do one of these three options;*

**-Keep mom’s last name *misspelled* and just submit my passport application with the *misspelled* last name matching the birth certificate**

*Or*

**-Use the *correct spelling* of my mom’s last name on the application but choose not to correct the misspelled last name on the birth certificate**

*Or*

**-Have my mom’s last name corrected on my brith certificate somehow, then submit my application with the corrected last name**

I’m assuming there’ll be issues either way, but I’m hoping to minimize complications if I’m able. I’d hate to pay for processing fees only for it to come back invalid.

Is highway 1 Class A friendly?

UPDATE: I decided to fly as I had no choice and was tight on cash. I took everyone’s advice & went to the doctor. They prescribed high dose ibuprofen and a steroid decongestion pill. Doctor said I had ear tube dysfunction. I also carried nasal spray with me. Had lots of chewing gum and tried to stay calm. I did facial massages as well to help with congestion.

Surprisingly, I experienced LESS pain than when I first landed and which caused my ear issues. My ear is still clogged. I’m gonna give it a few days and go to doctor if medicine hasn’t done the trick. Also thinking of going to proper ear doctor and checking for deviated septum as I usually do have weird ear pressure changes and headache before thunderstorm and when the barometric pressure is high. 

Thank you all so much for your help and advice!!!

I’m terrified of the pain or rupturing my ears during the flight back. Should I go to the doctor here? What should I do?

 I was thinking of maybe getting some xanax to knock me out during the flight so I could potentially sleep through the experience?

Japan+Turkey or Southern+Central Europe?",coloneleranmorad,"So, me and my gf are in this dilemma and can't choose which one is the best option. We figured out what our budget is and both of these options are catering for the same budget including flights and everything (Don't worry about the details why the budgets look the same. There are some cases of staying at friends at certain places, etc.)

Keep in mind, this is for mid June:

**Option 1: Japan + Turkey (4 weeks)**

\- We have been to Turkey before, but not Japan. The idea is to spend about 2 weeks in Japan and then go to Turkey and have a more laid back holiday there in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey mainly and a little bit of Istanbul.

\- Upsides of this plan is that Japan is a super exciting country for us and we would like to go to Turkey again. The visa process for these is pretty smooth as far as I understand with e-visas. Also, this will be a longer holiday, which we both want. This is also not the peak season of Japan due to weather. So, less crowded, cheaper prices, etc.

\- Downsides of this is seeing Japan at not its best season, but as far as I understand it's not too bad and definitely not as bad as July or August. The other downside is that it might be a bit tiring combining these two very far countries, but the idea is to rest in Turkey.

**Option 2: Italy + Germany + Austria (2 weeks)**  
\- We haven't been to any of these countries. The idea is to have about 9-10 days in Italy, starting from South and moving to North eventually and ending up in Munich.

\- Upsides of this plan is to see Europe in Summer and more pleasant weather, despite Southern Italy being a bit too hot at times, nice beaches would become useful. Probably not as tiring as the other plan since we will stay in one region and won't have any long flights once we get to Europe.

\- Downsides of this is spending the same money for 2 weeks less holiday feels like a rip off. We both haven't gone through Schengen before and that's quite a process, could even be declined.

**This means I might have as many as 6 extra days to play with.** I'd love to hear suggestions as to where I should spend more time or what places I should add to the itinerary.

I'm mostly looking to do day hikes (though toying with hiring some rental gear and doing some overnight kayaking Abel Tasman), some wine tasting where it makes sense, biking around Queenstown and taking in sights on the drives.

Tentative itinerary:

* Days 1-4: Arrive in Auckland, recover from jet lag and check it out, with day trips to Hobbiton, Tiritiri Matangi for wildlife or Waiheke for wineries.
* Day 5-6: Fly to Christchurch and check it out for a day
* Day 7: Pick up rental car, visit Kaikoura on way to Blenheim (308 km)
* Day 8: Malborough Sounds and wine tasting
* Day 9: Visit Nelson on the way to Abel Tasman (182 km)
* Day 10: Visit Abel Tasman
* Day 11: Drive to Punakaiki via St Arnaud (318 km) with short hike in Nelson Lakes
* Day 12: Drive to Franz Josef (221 km)
* Day 13: Drive to Haast (146 km)
* Day 14-16: Drive to Wanaka and explore the area (140 km)
* Day 17-19: Drive to Tekapo for stargazing and explore the area (194 km)

I am hoping that this sub might be able to give me tips to try and find the cheapest option. I thought of skyscanner, but every time I open a website from there, the price changes. Air Canada, KLM are the worst, and are charging me $4k for economy with layovers...

1j0vyp4,1740822217.0,Car hire in USA booked abroad,Current-Yoghurt-3097,"Hi all,

I am travelling to USA next month and will be hiring a car. I understand that rental cars don’t come with insurance over there so I need to consider that. I found a reasonable rate with Enterprise Rent a Car. What has surprised me is that if I make a booking through the Australian site (for a USA booking) it automatically adds the ‘damage waiver’ and ‘liability protection’ and the total price turns out to be around 50% of the price if selecting the same car and options on the US site. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? I am worried when I turn up to pick up the car they are going to charge me a hidden fee that hasn’t been disclosed.

1j04e4k,1740737286.0,Should you come early to the airport if you want to volunteer giving up your seat in an overbooked flight?,ssg_partners,"I was on a Lufthansa flight that was overbooked. During online check-in, they asked me if i wanted to volunteer giving up my seat for a later flight and also receive compensation. I wanted the free money and didn't care about flying later, therefore i responded yes on the app and finished checkin. It said that they will inform me at the gate if my offer to volunteer giving up my seat will be accepted or not.

I reached the gate exactly when the gate opened. I saw that the airline people at the gate had around 8 boarding passes and they were discussing something. I went up to them and told them i wanted to give up my seat. They said they had a couple of no-shows and they don't need volunteers anymore.

I wonder if i had reached the gate maybe an hour early, would it have increased the chances of the airline accepting my volunteering offer? It seemed like they accepted other people's offer but not mine.

Is it fair to say that if this situation comes up in the future, i can increase my chances by going really early to the airport and the gate so that i am the first one to give up my seat?",18,34,TravelHacks
1j0fmfm,1740769842.0,Can I use AAdvantage miles on already purchased ticket?,Mithendil,"Hello, complete newbie here. My wife and I are going on a trip March 18, booked with AA. I have 71k miles. The flights are PHL -> DFW -> HND, and returning HND -> LAX -> PHL. The tickets were a bit under $1600 each. I'm wondering if I'd be able to actually use my miles somehow? I was looking on the aa website and it would take a little over 91k miles to cover one person. I would have to spend about $650 to buy the 20k miles needed to cover that.  
  
My hypothetical plan is:  
1. refund my existing tickets (mine, not my wife's) for a travel credit. (I believe I got the kind that you can do that)  
2. use my travel credit to buy the 20k miles (\~$650)  
3. purchase the tickets for myself with those \~91k miles  
4. choose the same seats as my previous ticket had, next to my wife  
  
My questions are:  
\- does that plan seem reasonable?  
\- can I use travel credits to buy miles? (step 2)  
\- could I reasonably guarantee that I could get the same seat next to my wife? she is claustrophobic and would refuse to go if we don't sit together",2,3,TravelHacks

1j0hc1v,1740774227.0,Stroller Wagon to Gate Check for Flight?,Fun_Conclusion9695,"Ok so, going on a 5 week long trip to Amsterdam, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and China:  3 flights, cruise, train in China, and road trip across Australia. 

Wondering if anyone has experience with a folding stroller wagon I can take for my 1 and 2 year old to sit in. We have a front to back double stroller but the wheels are not great so it doesn’t turn so well. We need to be able to navigate with all of the travelling so I think it’s worth it to get a new one for this. We also can’t do a side by side because even narrow, there’s no way we’ll get through the narrow cruise ship hallways. Cannot do 2 strollers bc we’re just 2 adults and there’s no way we’ll be able to haul all of our things if we need 2 people to push the strollers.

I know proper wagons aren’t allowed on flights but the line between stroller and wagon is really blurred with all of the convertible, foldable things that are a front push out there. I also kind of am hoping to get a wagon stroller bc I’d be annoyed purchasing a double stroller that’s basically the same type of thing as the one I have, buying 2 of the same thing. Our stroller fits with our car seat too so kind of don’t want to completely replace the stroller we have. 

Flying KLM, Vietnam Airways, and Turkish if anyone has specific experience with these airlines. Please don’t tell me to look at the airline website because nothing they say clearly delineates what is defined as a stroller and what is defined as a wagon. They give measurement guidelines which helps but still want to be sure they’re not going to stop us and make us go back and check it for a hefty fee forcing us to drag our toddlers and our luggage through the airport 😬

Had a bad experience with American recently where they were trying to get us to check our regular stroller at check in even though it was right at the appropriate measurements for gate check. I had to explain to her that there’s no way we can carry 4 suitcases, 3 backpacks and 2 babies through ORD without our stroller.

While that’s a lot for me, I know some of you out there practically live on airplanes and in hotels. Still, I’ve picked up a few tips and tricks that work for my style and (large) physique. Here’s what I’ve learned—and maybe it’ll help you travel better, too.

I have added links to the bottom of this post.  

**1) Luggage & Bags**

[Briggs & Riley Baseline 2-Wheel Expandable Carry-On](https://www.briggs-riley.com/products/essential-2-wheel-carry-on)\
I’m 6’3” and 240 lbs., so my clothes are on the bigger side. I chose the two-wheel option because it offers more packing space than most spinners. It also has awesome expanding and compressing capabilities. I can fill it up for larger planes and then compress if I need to stuff it in smaller overhead bins.

[The Cary Briefcase – Double by Stuart & Lau](https://www.stuartandlau.com/products/the-cary-briefcase)\
I used to be a backpack guy, but this briefcase is sleek. It perches nicely on top of my carry-on handle, has all the organizational pockets I need, and it still holds my water bottle on the side. I clip my Sony noise-cancelling headphones (like the [WH-1000XM5](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/all-headphones/p/wh1000xm5)) to the outside using a screw-locking carabiner. Classy and practical.

**2) Clothing Strategies**

Create Seasonal Packing Lists\
-I keep separate lists for cold weather and warm weather trips. This helps me avoid the “Did I remember gloves?” panic.  I use the notes on IOS that allows me to checkmark what is packed and what is not.  

 Pants\
-Winter: I’m a fan of [Faherty colored denim](https://fahertybrand.com/collections/mens-stretch-terry) for a more polished casual look while keeping warm.\
-Summer: [Adidas golf pants](https://www.adidas.com/us/golf-pants) are lightweight, comfy, and look good enough for most client meetings (unless it’s more formal).

Shirts\
-Winter: Thicker button-ups or dress shirts (depending on the formality of the trip).\
-Summer: Polos or dress shirts.

Blazers\
-Winter: I’ve transitioned to sweater blazers ([Faherty Sweater Blazer](https://fahertybrand.com/products/inlet-knit-blazer-medium-grey-melange-1?variant=40176978657349)) in the winter and light weight deconstructed blazers in the summer.  I will use more traditional sports coats/blazers for client meetings.  \
-Summer: I tend to use pullovers and light weight blazers depending on client engagement.  [Faherty Light weight Blazer](https://fahertybrand.com/products/movement-coolmax-blazer-navy?variant=40175392096325)

Shoes\
-Year-Round: [Cole Hand Zerogrand](https://www.colehaan.com/mens-zerogrand-remastered-wingtip-oxfords/C39602.html) or [New Balance Tennis Shoes](https://www.newbalance.com/pd/574-core/ML574EVG-D-105.html?ecid=ps_Google_pla_195907802670_19759027876&crtp=paidsearch&ncr=true&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADQwqzYr4Y7SN3iRZJ7OdjwjCvi56&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvrT25LLliwMVWNbCBB0qxRy6EAQYAyABEgJw6vD_BwE) if I don’t have outside meetings. They’re stylish enough and comfortable for airport sprints.\
-Workout: Always pack a dedicated pair of running or training shoes to keep sweaty gym time separate from work wear.  I pack them in a [Shoe Travel Bag](https://a.co/d/1C5xMih) to avoid wet or grime getting in my bag.  

Workout Gear\
-Winter: Gloves, jogging pants, a running jacket, and a headlamp (safety first in dark or snowy conditions).\
-Summer: Usually just shorts and a t-shirt—if they’re dirty, I’ll do a quick sink wash.\
-I also have a random pair of bicycle shorts in my bag, in case I opt for a different workout than running.

Compression Socks\
-For any flight over 2 hours, I wear compression socks. I run 25+ miles a week, so my legs appreciate the circulation boost.  It helps keep away the uneasy fealings in my legs.  

**3) Organization & Packing Hacks**

Checklists, Checklists, Checklists\
-I keep a packing checklist for each bag, you can also add compartments.  I don’t mark anything off until it’s actually in the bag. This helps me avoid that sinking feeling that I left a something behind.  I specifically use IOS’ notes with checkmarks.  

Toiletry Bag + Electronics Bag, etc.  

-Toiletry Bag: I use the [State Bags Bensen Toiletry Kit](https://statebags.com/collections/best-sellers-2/products/laguardia-dopp-kit-printed-canvas-camo?_pos=5&_fid=3baa23e2a&_ss=c) for all my personal items. It stays in my carry-on.\
-Electronics Bag: [The Incase Nylon Accessory & Electronics Bag](https://incase.com/products/nylon-accessory-organizer) organizes my chargers, power banks, adapters, etc. It’s saved me from rummaging around for loose cords more times than I can count.  This lives in my carry-on (for hotel room use). It houses my [Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station](https://www.anker.com/products/a2557-maggo-qi2-wireless-charging-station-magsafe-compatible?variant=43008153616534&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pmax&utm_campaign=us_anker_all_conversion_pmax_maggo24_purchase_ost_24Q3&utm_content=maggo24&utm_term={21665970926}_{}_{}&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADbnO270uvWxC1rc9-zSyFiHIxBV7&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv_nTlJjliwMVEMwWBR3AVSTlEAQYBCABEgJvGPD_BwE)\
-Another mesh bag for charging wires lives in my briefcase (for airplanes, rental cars, or office setups). No more losing cables or untangling everything mid-flight.  I have the cheap velcro accessory ties for all cables.\
-I use the same mesh for receipt collection on my travels.  They are color coded and I think I got them on Amazon ([Mesh bags for cords and receipts](https://a.co/d/e7VMP4A)).

Compression (But Not Cubes)\
-I tried packing cubes but found them inefficient—my expandable Briggs & Riley is essentially its own compression system. Packing cubes became rigid spheres that didn’t fill the corners and wasted space.

Waterproof Compression Sack for Dirty Clothes\
-I use a [Felaxy waterproof sack](https://a.co/d/568zJSQ) to separate wet, dirty workout clothes from the rest. I don’t fully compress it (to keep it flexible in my suitcase).

**4) On the Plane**

Security Lines: CLEAR + TSA PreCheck\
-I enjoy having CLEAR along with TSA PreCheck. It doesn’t always help (depending on the airport setup), but when it does, it’s a huge time-saver. If you’re traveling as much as I do, shaving minutes off your security wait can really add up.

Seat Choice\
-I personally prefer the exit row over premium economy. Extra legroom plus enough space to store my bag under the seat. I’m right-handed, so I pick an aisle seat on the left side of the plane. That way, my dominant “chicken wing” can stick out into the aisle rather than bump my neighbor.

Hydration\
-I always travel with hydration packets (like Liquid I.V.). They help me recover from time zone changes and just keep me feeling better overall.

Entertainment & Accessibility

I travel with a PC computer, iPad Pro, and a SuperNote notebook for different needs:\
-PC for full-on work tasks (spreadsheets, emails, etc.).\
-iPad Pro for entertainment, reading, or emails.\
-SuperNote for that pen-on-paper feel during note-taking.\
-Noise-cancelling headphones are clipped to my breif for easy access on the airplane.  I always unclip them once I arrive at the hotel room.\
-Air Pod Pro are my headphones of choice for off the airplane.

**5) Hotel Habits**

Initial Cleanliness Check\
-As soon as I enter, I do a quick walk-through to ensure everything is clean. Pull back the sheets to check the bed. It’s way easier to swap rooms before unpacking.\

Unpacking Method\
-I hang up dress clothes. Everything else sits on a tabletop or desk. I’m paranoid about leaving things behind, so not using dresser drawers means fewer “Where did I put that?” moments.

Negotiating Rates\
-I tested 8 hotels in Dallas before settling on one I liked. Then, I simply asked for a preferred rate, aiming for under $200. They offered me $170. Always ask!

**6) Electronics & Extras**

Extension Cord & Power Banks\
-I always pack an [Anker extension cord](https://a.co/d/7XiPPv1) in my carry-on. Hotel rooms aren’t always friendly with outlet placement.\
-My go-to power bank is the [Anker MagGo Wireless Power Bank](https://www.anker.com/products/a1664-maggo-10000mah-power-bank?ref=naviMenu&variant=44058070548630), and I’ve actually bought it twice. (I lost the black one, so now I have the white version with a sticker for easy visibility.)

Stickers for Identification\
-I slap Bigfoot stickers on everything (laptop, phone case, even my charger). If you leave a plain grey laptop in an airport, good luck. A unique sticker or label helps a ton in reuniting lost stuff with its owner.  I even have an iron on Bigfoot patch on my carry on and briefcase.

**7) Credit Cards & Rewards**\
I use three main cards to maximize points and perks.  I’m lucky to able to use my own cards and I feel like they all have a positive ROI.

Alaska Airlines Credit Card\
-Great for booking flights if you primarily fly Alaska. Companion fares is nice and the points bonus is great.\
Hilton Aspire\
-Comes with automatic Hilton Diamond status, a free weekend night reward, and resort credits.\
Amex Platinum\
-Broad travel benefits, including lounge access (if that’s your jam), airline fee credits, and various travel protections.

**8) What Didn’t Work for Me**\
Packing Cubes\
-Once I compress my carry-on, cubes end up rigid and don’t mold to the extra spaces. I felt there was wasted room.\
Using Drawer\
-I prefer to keep my stuff visible in the hotel room.\
One set of cables/power banks\
-Dedicating an electronics (cables/powerbacks) works better for me.  I don’t have to pack cables/cords up every day to go into a location.

Once I logged in with my account the cheaper price remained throughout checkout process and purchased the flight.  Its 13.50 even if I want to add it now after purchase.

1. I got a Southwest Rapid Rewards card to start. There was a Companion Pass sign on offer. I should hit the minimum by the end of February, which gives me both the pass and 30k points.
2. Next step is for my wife to get a Ink Business Preferred (she owns a small business). I can refer her and get 10k points (I think?), then she hits her minimum of $8,000 and gets 90k points. Can she even get this card? Her credit is good.
3. Final step is for me to get a Sapphire. Unsure if I should do Preferred or Reserve. Unsure if she can refer me and we get another 10k points. $4,000 within 3 months gets me 60k points.

1ixqdle,1740472582.0,Still struggle with yearly flights despite having experience - Tips to become a more savvy flyer?,Nowheretoturn48,"I make yearly trips from the US to Asia to celebrate Lunar New Year that last between one and three months. I've done it several times, and I will continue for the foreseeable future. That said, although I have experience doing it I still feel that I'm not as ""prepared"" as I could be. Unreliable bank access...US SIM card deactivated...lack of good VPN...inefficiently packed bags. It's never anything that ""ruins"" the trip, but it all adds up into inconvenient annoyances that I'd like to fix going forward.

Bank stuff:

* My US bank is on the smaller end and they aren't necessarily set up to accommodate international purchases / debit card usage
* Purchases outside the US are often flagged as suspicious and require me to call them or they (and my card) remain frozen

Phone & computer stuff:

* My SIM card stops working outside of US cell networks, meaning any site that requires two-factor authorization (such as my bank among other things) are inaccessible
* I don't know any good, reliable, **free** VPNs. A few sites are blocked even when I start up the couple VPNs I've tried

Airline stuff:

* When booking tickets, I typically just Google \[airport\] to \[airport\] and pick a random travel site like Expedia or Kayak (whoever shows the best flight). But despite that, I never bothered signing up for any customer loyalty, so I'm probably missing out on a bunch of freebies
* Also, since I typically book through travel sites I'm not part of any specific airline's frequent flier programs. I usually fly to Asia via All Nippon Airways (ANA) or Japan Airlines (JAL), so I should definitely sign up for their programs to start accruing free stuff, right?
* **Big one: The airlines never let me complete online check-in when the window opens up 24 hours before the flight. They always say something like ""This flight requires document verification - Please check-in at the airport"" - I think because they need to check my passport and visa. The problem with that is that by the time I get to the check-in counter 3 hours before the flight, all of the good seats are picked and I'm stuck worrying if I'll have a middle seat for 13 hours**

Flight stuff:

* I can never fall asleep on flights. ANA and JAL flights have enough leg room for me, but something about the fact that my arms/head not feeling ""secure"" (aka they can move around too much as I drift off to sleep) makes it just impossible to nod off for more than a couple minutes

Bag stuff:

* I tend to bring too many clothes, which takes up valuable space when I'm making the return trip and have gifts for friends and family
* My carry on (backpack) tends to be filled to the absolute brim with my laptop...toiletries...change of clothes...jacket...hat...tissue...wet wipes...anything else I may need on the flights but isn't crucial enough to go in my smaller sling bag **(as I write this section, I'm realizing that I should probably just upgrade from a backpack to a bigger roller bag)**
* Coming back to the US, my bags are always pushing the weight limit (usually 23kg per bag maximum). What's the highest quality, lightest weight baggage that won't break the bank (I realize the last qualifier limits the selection by a lot)

I noticed the Lufthansa flight which has 1 stop in between and uses multiple airlines for the round trip. It does not say self transfer. However, I’m confused about the baggage. Do I pay one time for the baggage fee for the whole trip? In the flight details, it shows multiple statements of paying for baggage in each part of the flight. This is the “economy light” if that makes a difference. The reason I’m questioning the baggage is because the flight is about $1800, which is the cheapest option, so there must be something else to it?

citizenm hotel near cdg:

pro:
it’s really close (a five min walk) to terminal 3 and it’s pretty close to terminal 2. there’s a train that goes directly to paris and back
it’s clean
the staff are really nice

cons:
it feels like an upscale hostel tbh and is overpriced 
the food is expensive and nothing to write home about 
no slippers 
the beds is not that comfy, seems like a bad mattress with a memory foam topper

verdict: ok for two nights but id be curious to check out easyhotel next time since its a lot cheaper and probably more or less the same quality 

cdg

i flew out of terminal 2e, got there 3 hours+ ahead, was done with everything in less than an hour. still a good bet to come 3 hrs early for intl flights but the airport is definitely not as bad as advertised.

the flight left out of L gates. i enjoyed my time there - there’s cafes, restaurants, a smoking room (that’s actually well ventilated) and comfy chairs and such.

4/5 cdg, had a good time

airfrance

decent. was late for two hours. the crew was super nice. food was ok. 

a decent flight experience all in all but turkish airlines is a lot better - in 10+ hr flights, it’s the small things that add up and turkish has way more cool small things (better lighting, better blankets, more in the amenity kit, better food, just a better vibe).

i will say tho, airfrance has better entertainment options, more movies

also the airfrance flight was really cold for whatever reason

Edit: Thanks for your replies. Of course, I did my research and spent most of my time wild camping. But do you know if there are any solutions for sharing high-priced accommodations with others?",18,0,TravelHacks

Pick a row of 4, hope the middle two stay free (ask again at the airport if they have one left and are willing to block seats) or upgrade to business class, ask for a basinet and hope she sleeps?

Business apparently has 10 seats left on the first leg and 20 on the second. Last time we flew Qatar, we upgraded and they gave us a whole Q-suite so she got her own bed... not sure if emirates would do that because they don't have those suites.

Upon looking on LinkedIn, it seems there are dozens of travel agencies in every corner of the world. It seems like everyone is a travel agent. People who I highly doubt have traveled extensively. Not dogging them, but I mean, how are they to advise? Anyways, I applied to a few of them and nearly all of them offered me a position. I then go on Facebook to the jobs page in my state and it seems there’s MULTIPLE travel agencies hiring agents with no knowledge or work history? I don’t understand what exactly a travel agent does. I have, by the grace of God, been able to claw my way out of any potential challenge and get back and forth to any country I land it. It is my duty to learn how that country is…. Or don’t. I assume the only reason you’d want a travel agent is for advice, to save money, or convenience. But how does a travel agent advise on any given country if they haven’t been there? How is this a no experience job? How do they save you money if they need to get paid and eat too? Is it simply people want someone else to do their logistical planning for them and don’t mind paying?

1isfats,1739892633.0,A Tale of Two Islands: Exploring the Dual Charms of St. Martin,Artistic_Maximum3044,"Having just returned from St. Martin, I can personally attest that this Caribbean Island offers a unique travel experience where visitors can explore two distinct cultures on a single island. Split between French Saint-Martin in the north and Dutch Sint Maarten in the south, this tropical paradise combines European sophistication with laid-back Caribbean charm.

# Pristine Beaches

The island’s coastline is dotted with 37 stunning beaches, each with its own character. Orient Bay, often called the “St. Tropez of the Caribbean,” stretches along the French side with powdery white sand and crystal-clear waters perfect for water sports. For a more secluded experience, Happy Bay offers a hidden gem accessible by a short hike, rewarding visitors with pristine shores and excellent snorkeling opportunities.

Maho Beach on the Dutch side provides a unique attraction: planes landing at Princess Juliana International Airport fly so low over the beach that visitors can almost touch them. Meanwhile, Mullet Bay offers gentle waves ideal for beginning surfers and families.

The French side of St. Martin is a gastronomic paradise, particularly in Grand Case, known as the culinary capital of the Caribbean. Here, elegant restaurants serve sophisticated French cuisine with a Caribbean twist. The true stars, however, are the authentic French bakeries scattered throughout the northern half of the island. Every morning, the aroma of fresh croissants, pain au chocolate, and crusty baguettes wafts through the streets of Marigot, the French capital.

Local patisseries like Sarafina’s in Marigot offer perfectly flaky pastries that transport you straight to Paris. Don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy a morning coffee with fresh-baked goods while watching the world go by from a café terrace.

# Two Nations, One Island

The dual heritage of St. Martin creates a fascinating cultural tapestry. The French side maintains a distinctly European atmosphere, with its capital Marigot featuring charming colonial architecture and open-air markets. The Wednesday and Saturday markets are particularly popular, offering local spices, fresh produce, and handcrafted items.

Cross the border to the Dutch side (a transition so seamless you might miss it), and you’ll find yourself in a more commercialized atmosphere. Philipsburg, the Dutch capital, features duty-free shopping along Front Street and numerous casinos, adding a dash of Vegas-style entertainment to your Caribbean getaway.

# Practical Tips

* The island accepts both euros and dollars, though each side prefers its own currency
* No passport is required to cross between sides
* Peak season runs from December to April
* Consider renting a car to explore both sides thoroughly
* Many restaurants on the French side close during low season (May-November)
* The French side tends to be quieter and more expensive, while the Dutch side offers more nightlife and entertainment options

Whether you’re seeking French sophistication, Dutch liveliness, or simply want to lounge on some of the world’s most beautiful beaches, St. Martin offers a Caribbean experience unlike any other. The island’s dual personality ensures that every traveler finds their perfect vacation rhythm, whether that’s sipping espresso at a French café or dancing the night away at a Dutch beach bar. Having just returned from St. Martin, I can personally attest that this Caribbean Island offers a unique travel experience where visitors can explore two distinct cultures on a single island. Split between French Saint-Martin in the north and Dutch Sint Maarten in the south, this tropical paradise combines European sophistication with laid-back Caribbean charm.

1ismoka,1739910353.0,Color of personal item,IRedditIKnowThings,"Hi all,

I am getting ready to purchase a new personal item for airline travel to accompany my rolling suitcase. What I am confused about is the color – while some of the other colors like green and blue look appealing, I am concerned that they will get badly marked up And scuffed with stains, etc., particularly for an item that is almost always going to go under the seat with all kinds of plane debris touching it, plus my own shoes touching it. 
So even though black looks boring, I am considering sticking to black as it will hide all kinds of discoloration and scuffs. Do any of you have any personal experience with this and want to talk me out of it? I would love to get other colors but am concerned they will look bad after just a few trips. 
The bag itself is made of made of ballistic nylon, so fairly durable – a link to the bag for those interested. Thank you in advance.

I will be using a nike gym bag wich is a bit bigger than those measurements while measuring it. How strict are the companies at checking the dimensions? And if the bag is soft enough to squish it in would this be okay? I would appreciate any respone.

However, im planning a trip to DR this year and was thinking about layover times and was informed that I could pulled at customs every time I travel internationally. So keeping that in mind, I know its best to plan for 2-3 hrs for a layover internationally, would that still be the same knowing im most likely going to get pulled to the side at customs, or should I aim for 3-4hrs? My other issue is, most flights im seeing have tend to have a max layover of 2.5 hrs.

I called Emirates, United and Singapore Airlines and I told them I have enough points for Business class. They told me that even though I book right now, they cannot guarantee a seat until a week before the flight.

1irt1i5,1739822033.0,Please help with 2 international trips,xwalker4,"Hello all,

I have 2 upcoming European trips this year. One is for a friend's wedding in Greece. We would be leaving from the east coast of the US to Athens and then to Samos where the wedding is.

The second trip is to Italy for our own honeymoon, likely the Amalfi Coast region.

Anyway, my questions are as follows:

I have 3 credit cards. My main one is Chase Sapphire Preferred. I have about 500,000 Ultimate Rewards points,

I have the Amazon/Whole Foods VISA that I use for amazon purchases. We recently moved from the city to the suburbs, so we don't really use it at Whole Foods much anymore.

I have an old Chase Southwest card that I do not use for anything.

My questions would be, is there a better strategy to maximize rewards or options for our travel? I really have nothing besides the 500,000 UR points. Would I be better served opening another credit card to take advantage of something I'm not currently?

The flights to Greece and Italy and the lodging in Athens and Naples/Positano would all be areas where I might be able to improve my situation. (The lodging in Samos is taken care of.)

Thanks, everybody!
