I'm travelling to USA from Australia with a friend for the first time. We have a month and access to a newish car from a friend we don't have to pay for. 


We're planning on landing in LA,  having a week to drive to New Orleans, stopping for a few days, then up to Kansas, stopping for a few days, then heading back to LA through Colorado/Utah over 10 days. 


We thought it would be a fun way to see America and some less touristy areas. However we've been told by one American that it's a silly way to do it and it we'll just be driving, seeing nothing, and spending a lot on fuel. 


I've gone through it all with my friend and it seems doable, some days longer driving, other days shorter but I have no idea about travelling America, second opinions are very welcome! Thank you



Edit: we have a good friend who lives in Kansas!

1jczvtw,2025-03-17 00:16:57,Traveling for Work as Extremely Morbidly Obese,swindeo,"Required to take a cross-country flight for new job. Completely reimbursable travel expenses. 

The problem is that I weigh 470 lbs, am 6’, and obviously cannot fit in a normal seat and probably need a second seat. I was planning on paying for two seats and reimbursing one of them, taking the hit on the other - totally reasonable to expect the company to not pay for two seats for one person, so I’m fully fine with taking the hit on that. 

The problem is, my boss  is trying to be nice and helpful and take over the process using his corporate card to book everything and is trying to book it himself so that I don’t have to pay for anything - except… we’ve never physically met in person. You can tell from my face that I’m large, but you may not understand how large I am without physically meeting me. 

I mentioned to him a few weeks ago that I was anticipating needing a second seat or a larger (first class) seat that I would be fully comfortable paying for myself. He said that he just tries to get an aisle seat. “It’ll be uncomfortable but that’s flying. They don’t let me fly first class so that’s not happening”

What do I do? I don’t feel comfortable arguing my case with him, I’m still brand new and don’t feel like I have any ground to stand on. I’m worried if I don’t book a second seat that I’ll be removed from the flight when someone complains. 

Please help. 

And please don’t say “lose weight”. I’ve already lost 85 pounds+ and trip is in 2 weeks.

1jdv8mu,2025-03-18 02:49:04,Lost carry-on suitcase waiting for flight at Chicago O'Hare,AmbitiousLand2587,"So like the title says I was flying from Chicago to LAX today with a backpack and a carry on. I live in LA. I get through security with both bags, get snacks from two different stores, use the men's bathroom, and then head to the gate and did some work. When my group is called for boarding, I look down and realize that my carry on is gone. Frantically, I run to both stores I stopped in and the bathroom and can't find it anywhere. I end up opting to miss my flight and look around the airport for 3 hours, and I couldn't find it anywhere. The police told me to talk to the American airlines people, who told me they have a lost & found but it's not open till the next day. I ended up opting to rebook for another flight later that same day (I'm actually on the flight now) and try my luck with the desk via phone tomorrow once I'm settled. I have a buddy in Chicago who can pick it up for me if they have it, or would pay the shipping. I also opened up a lost ticket with both American and TSA to cover my bases. The bag doesn't have my name on it and is a pretty generic roller.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to best approach recovering my bag? I know for a fact I got it through security so it was lost somewhere in that terminal. I fly a lot and am usually not very forgetful so I'm pretty confused as to what happened. I guess two options:

1. I spaced and left it unattended and it was taken to lost and found (or worse stolen/destroyed by the cops)
2. Someone grabbed it by accident thinking it was theirs (which I doubt because that meant a very similar bag would have been hanging around and I looked everywhere I had been 2-3 times)

Any advice or suggestions for how to best approach this would be so appreciated. That bag has a lot of important things to me and I would be pretty pretty crushed if it was indeed gone.",27,7,travel,"Lost carry-on suitcase waiting for flight at Chicago O'Hare So like the title says I was flying from Chicago to LAX today with a backpack and a carry on.

Just wondering if anyone has had a similar issue and a workaround.

We are on board to Singapore to transit to Vietnam with our visas approved weeks ago for the full duration. The issue is I didn't realise they needed the full proof/screenshot of the website page that shows the visa acceptance rather than just the E Visa number (biggest lesson learnt).

Vietnams government website to search the E Visa online is offline/down and on permanent loading when you search for the e visa number.

We've got probably 3 hours before we have to make the call to camp at Singapore overnight and hope the website is back up and running by tomorrow.

My bf speaks Danish and has lived in Copenhagen on and off for a few years though he hasn't had the opportunity to explore the countryside very much. 

I've been wanting to explore CPH for a few days since it is likely we will relocate there in a couple of years, then go to the countryside, biking and camping for the remainder of the trip. 

I've heard that Bornholm is the perfect place for that, so initially I thought about spending 4 days in CPH then 5 days biking and camping in Bornholm instead of moving around too much but I'd be curious to hear some feedback from locals or from people who have spent some time in the Danish countryside. 

Is Bornholm boring, or over-touristy? Are we better off camping and biking in another area?

xi4qz9,2022-09-19 07:10:24,Do not ever visit Egypt,tigerhawk2005,"I am an American man who came to visit Egypt, but I felt so extremely unwelcome.

I went to the pyramids of Giza and they were truly majestic, but I couldn't walk more than a few steps without being harassed and hustled by the many of the touts trying to sell things or services. They were trying to sell me camel and horse rides, trying to give me a guided tour, trying to sell me worthless crap trinkets, trying to take my phone from me and take pictures of me and my family and then demanding an absurd amount of money.

One guy that I got on top of his camel for pictures asked for money so I gave him $10 USD and he started yelling and screaming at me asking for $100 USD. I thought he is going to attack me, my family and I just quickly ran away from him.

My family member got her phone snatched and the guy took pictures of her telling her to make all these poses, and then he wouldn't give the phone back to her until she paid him $20 and then he kept complaining about how $20 is nothing and that he deserves more.

One guy came up to me to pose in a picture with me and I told him to go away but he wouldn't. He stayed in the picture while my family member was taking the pictures and then he asked for money, I got so extremely mad and I screamed at him at the top of my lungs to go away. All of the other travelers around there heard and were looking and then only did the guy go away.

Then trying to walk around Giza and Cairo, just forget about it. It's virtually impossible. All of the touts coming up to us and asking if we need a ride, or if we can buy their whatever shit trinkets they are selling. We couldn't walk more than literally 60 seconds without someone new coming to harass us.

What is it about this place that makes visitors feel so unwelcome? Why do they do this? There is so much rich history and culture to Egypt that I am sure everyone all around the world would want to visit, but why do the touts push us away instead of making us feel welcome?

When I came back to the US and all my coworkers asked me how it was, I told them the pyramids and temples were amazing, but the touts were absolutely horrible. I told them not to go, and that I would never step my foot back in Egypt ever again.",2349,19252,travel,"Do not ever visit Egypt I am an American man who came to visit Egypt, but I felt so extremely unwelcome.

1epj1jn,2024-08-11 11:55:41,Leaving Türkiye heartbroken and feeling like the entire country is set up as a scam,euroeismeister,"I’ll preface this by saying that my grandmother was born and raised in Türkiye (diplomats). She loved the country, spoke Turkish, and returned nearly every year. She took me there about 20 years ago and as a 12 year old, I really loved it. 

Fast forward these past two decades and I’m so excited to take my spouse there. I am now sitting at IST feeling completely the opposite. Here is just a small section of why I felt so scammed by nearly the entire experience in only 3 days:

- The airport approved taxi with fixed price tried to rip us off for 3x the fixed price into Istanbul. He locked the doors when I refused to pay the inflated price and threatened to call the police. I managed to get the locked door open and leave the agreed upon payment on the seat. 

- We had the “tourist price” menus constantly given to us with massive price gouging. Then when a Turkish friend joined us for dinner, we found out what was happening. Not to mention the constant yelling and cajoling of street scammers trying to get their next victim. 

- My spouse fell for the common shoe shine scam. This is my fault for not warning her so shame on me. She is also the nicest person I know so it feels even worse. But this guy actually ended up reaching into her bag and grabbing her wallet and removing 20€ (all that was in it thankfully) before running off. So aggressive. 

- I wanted to take a photo of the building where my great-grandfather worked. It used to be an embassy, but is now a social club. I was angrily screamed at and told to leave despite being on a public sidewalk. I tried to explain why I wanted a photo using Google translate and the “security man” only screamed more and threatened to call the cops unless I paid him. I just ended up walking away and into the hotel across the street. 
- We just wanted to buy some Turkish delight to take home to my spouse’s mother. The shop owner charged us 4x what was told to us it would be when he wrapped it up. He threatened to call the cops if we didn’t pay, so we did, and now I am contesting the charge with the credit card company. We are two women in a foreign country so it’s not like we are going to keep arguing with some random man we don’t know.

- Our hotel demanded we pay half our room in cash and were pressuring us at check out to write a “five star” review online while standing there. Constant two-faced behaviour, especially when the wifi stopped working and the lift went out. 

- Finally, let’s just even look at this airport. The view that every foreigner is a piggy bank continues. 22€ for a f***ing burger at Burger King even at an inflated airport price is insane. There are not that many places to fill up water bottles either, so I suppose it’s 10€ for a bottle or just dehydrate yourself! Oh, and want internet? You only get it for an hour and you have to go get a special password! World’s best airport? Maybe world’s best scam airport. 

I’ve lived in multiple Global South countries and never have I been so eager to leave a place, even where less developed than Türkiye so this is not some “western tourist” issue. Türkiye really has an issue on its hands and it is very lucky it has such beautiful and significant historical and religious sites to encourage people to come. It seemed every time we left our hotel we were barraged with scammers viewing two Dutch blonde women as being rich. One of us is a school teacher and the other works in international development so we are not flush with cash. From start to finish, I felt extremely sad and guilty for feeling so upset and angry since this was my grandmother’s favourite place. I pride myself in being culturally respectful and sensitive, but even trying to take a step back and looking at it all from their perspective didn’t help. I would never dream of scamming anyone out of money while also pretending to be kind. Another box of worms: these guys scam, never face any consequences, but me, the gay person, has to pretend not to be while I’m in the country to be respectful of the homophobic culture and protect myself from being the victim of discrimination and crime. Makes total sense. 

For a country that wants so badly to be part of the European community, shame on it for supporting and tolerating this culture of scam. I’ve travelled plenty throughout countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, etc. also wanting to be in the European Union and never once felt like every move was vulnerable to being scammed. 

I have many Turkish friends in the Netherlands and now fully understand why they wouldn’t want to live in Türkiye. I understand this population of scammers represents a small portion of Turkish people and most people are good, but the country needs to stop allowing this sort of culture. Tons of police officers stand around doing nothing. There’s almost no way to report this sort of thing to be taken seriously. These men are allowed to yell from their shops and overcharge “idiot” foreigners. 

I really supported the country before this, but now I will never come back to this country that my grandmother loved so dearly. I really am heartbroken.

13hmnlx,2023-05-14 20:36:59,What I like and dislike about the USA.... as a tourist.,MickJof,"I have been touring the United States for several weeks now, visiting multiple states. I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.

This is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.

I'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.

I am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.

Thinks I like

* Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.
* People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.
* Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.
* Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.
* The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

Things I don't like

* Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.
* The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.
* Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.
* Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?

So here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe.",791,10968,travel,"What I like and dislike about the USA.... as a tourist.

1eqk4es,2024-08-12 17:41:07,"Lost in the Amazon jungle in Peru thanks to an incompetent guide, lucky to be alive. Company won't even refund us what we paid. ",Happy_Bookkeeper7933,"Booked a three day jungle trip from Iquitos, Peru. Within the first few hours, thanks to the extremely negligent (bordering on the reckless) decisions of the company and guide (edit: see company name below), we were completely lost deep in the Amazon jungle with no food, water or any safety supplies. Guide had collapsed from exhaustion and lay down to die, refusing to get up. Rescue was nothing short of a miracle. Full story is below - Any thoughts on how to make the company take some sort of responsibility are appreciated.

——

My brother (21M) and I (27F) have always wanted to do a trip into the jungle, so planned an entire itinerary in Peru around doing so. We looked at a few different online tours, and booked a two-night tour leaving from Iquitos and going into the Amazon. The tour was one of the less luxurious options but had very good reviews so we felt it was a safe choice. We spent the days leading up to it in Lima procuring and stocking our day packs with safety supplies (correct clothing and gear, strong insect repellent, flashlights, medicines) and researching how to be safe. We were worried about lethal snake or spider bites, jaguars, caimans, mosquito-borne diseases etc, but the golden rule from all of the advice online was to always trust and follow your guide and you’ll be safe, as they know the jungle and will always cut a safe path for you and point out dangers. Thousands of people do Amazon tours every year and have a great time. We were really excited.

On the day the trip was starting, we met at the office in Iquitos and then took a boat for about an hour and a half down the Amazon river. The small group doing our tour included our guide (Peruvian \~35M but seemed to speak good English), a young girl who seemed to serve no purpose except to accompany him, and a mother and daughter (\~55F and 30F), the latter of which spoke fluent English and Spanish.

The boat made a couple of five minute stops along the way, firstly to get some gas and then to let some other guests off. It stopped a third time at about 11am and our guide motioned for us to get off. We thought we must be starting the tour so picked up our bags, but he told us to leave our bags on the boat. We assumed this was just another five minute stop. We asked if we needed our gumboots, and he said no.

We follow him off the boat. When we get up the river bank, he looks at our empty hands and asks “do you not have any water?” We were extremely confused as he had told us to leave our things on the boat and hadn’t explained what we were doing. He says “don’t worry, we are just doing a short 20-minute walk down the the track to a local village so you'll be fine.” The guide didn't have any water either. My brother and I are a bit concerned, but by the time we turn around the boat has already left with our stuff (including our water, carefully chosen repellent etc), so we trust that we only have a short period of walking and we follow the guide down the track into the jungle.

The first 20 minutes are lovely and the guide is exemplary of what we had read online, pointing out interesting insects and telling us which ones to avoid, and showing us the safe places to step. At some point though, he leads us off the track and into the deep jungle. I’m completely unconcerned and assuming this is all part of the plan. He tells us later that this is because he came across a large fallen tree over the track and we had to go around it.

Things start to go a bit awry from here. We walk through the deep jungle for an hour or so, and our guide is becoming less responsible. He’s charging ahead and leaving us to cut our own path (he doesn’t have a machete or delicate instructions of where to step like the guides we read about online). We have to clamber over trunks, under vines, avoid vicious ants, and get stuck in mud. Luckily we didn’t encounter anything more deadly; god knows it was definitely lurking. The mother who was with us fell over a few times and the guide didn't seem to care.

Eventually we make it to a small clearing and are starting to get a bit fed up, given we are yet to reach the village and are getting hungry, thirsty, sweaty, muddy and bitten. But, we are relieved to be out of the thick forest. The clearing has a basic bamboo shelter, and a little stream with two small aluminium boats. Is this the village? Our guide tells us to wait here and disappears for another half an hour without communicating anything to us, which is extremely irritating. He eventually returns and explains that we have to go back as “the boat that was meant to pick us up isn’t there”, which doesn’t make any sense as we thought we were heading to a village. He says it will be 20 minutes maximum to get back to the river and, to our relief, starts leading us along a small dirt track. At this point (probably around 2pm) we just want to get back ASAP - we’re hungry and thirsty. To our dismay, he shortly leads us off the track again back into the jungle, pointing at the sun and saying that he can tell which direction the river is in. Although annoyed that we have to wade through mud again, I still at this point have no suspicion that we are lost, and trust that he knows exactly where he’s taking us. My brother isn’t so sure, and says to us “if he’s using the sun as navigation I’m not that confident about this”. The rest of us laugh and follow our guide as all of the online advice told us to do. Stick with the guide, you’ll be fine.

We stumble our way through the deep jungle without any assistance. By now, the guide is charging so far ahead that we can barely see him and have to keep yelling out to him. We are being bitten by red ants which is very painful, falling over and wading through mud, where we could hear running water bubbling underneath us. At one point, I fell thigh-deep into a muddy swamp and screamed, half expecting a caiman to bite my legs off (our gumboots would have come in handy if we hadn't been told leave them behind). The guide did not seem to care. At this point we scream to him to slow the fuck down and wait for us because this is extremely dangerous. He eventually does and stops to talk to us, saying that we should wait here (in the middle of nowhere) and his colleague will bring us food and water. Again, we are confused. He then leaves again into the jungle before we can stop him. We are in disbelief.  We look around and there is dense forest/swamp in all directions and we are being constantly bitten by mosquitos. We don't want to wait here for long, especially without water and repellent.

He returns a few minutes later looking extremely exhausted, having taken off his shirt, and collapses onto the forest floor. Between desperate gasps for breath, he finally drops the act and admits he has no idea where we are. We are completely lost.

It soon becomes clear that we have been lost for hours. We figure the guide was charging ahead to try and find a familiar path and completely exhausted himself doing so. He has collapsed shirtless on a muddy log, with loads of insects biting him. He is too exhausted to care. He is delirious and completely incoherent, seemingly forgetting how to speak English except to ask for water (which we didn’t have) - luckily the daughter in our group could translate for us, because he managed to get a bit of phone reception and called his boss. We learned from her that he could not explain to his boss where on earth we were. He was even trying to describe the clearing with the two boats (which the boss did not recognise), showing that we were already lost all the way back then, and he had tried to hide it from us all that time. He had nothing with him to prepare for this situation: no flare, no water, no machete, no GPS, not even a compass.

We spend the next hour or so trying to think logically about how to survive. We got the guide’s phone password and contacts as it seemed that we were going to lose him at any minute. Although I didn’t have reception, my google map had partially loaded so that we could perhaps see the direction of the river and hack through the jungle to make our way to it and hopefully flag someone down. I was nervous about doing this because (1) it meant leaving the guide (who kept insisting he couldn't stand), leaving us without his knowledge of the jungle but also leaving him to die; (2) I really doubted whether the map was correct and (3) it would mean hours navigating the thick jungle by ourselves, risking encountering deadly animals, dangerous tribes, anything. And, we probably only had an hour of sunlight left...

We were all extremely thirsty and were trying not to panic, but things were not looking good. It was extremely hot and muddy, mosquitoes were flying everywhere, and we were on constant alert for snakes, spiders, jaguars etc. Everyone remained extremely calm and thought logically which was a blessing (the mother and I shared a hug; I think she suspected I was about to get upset), and we were so lucky to have the other two in our group, but it was looking like we were going to have to try and survive the night (or longer) in the Amazon jungle without water, without a guide, and without any of our supplies.

The daughter then manages to get a bit of reception on her phone and can speak directly to the boss herself, although we still have no way of describing our whereabouts. We send him a screenshot of my half-loaded map image. She contacts her boyfriend and tells him that she will likely die in the jungle and that she loves him, but can he please contact the authorities asap. We ask our guide what the emergency number in Peru is and he brazenly refuses to tell us (I guess because he was worried about getting in trouble). So does his pointless girlfriend.

We discuss our options, including the risk of leaving the guide behind, as he is still refusing to move or offer any advice despite our pleas. We eventually decide that, because the sun is going down and because of the risks associated with trying to get to the river, we are safer trying to go back the way we came and at least find the dirt track, which is safer from nature than the deep jungle and which also has a better chance of someone coming along the track and finding us. My brother is confident that he can remember the way back (I’m not). The guide, realising that we are about to leave him here on his own, gets a new lease of life and we are able to heave him to his feet. He stumbles ahead behind my brother, and I’m at the back with the other three girls. We are all trying not to break down.

Eventually, dozens of ant stings later, we hear a faint motor engine in the distance. We start screaming for help at the top of our lungs. To our dismay, it sounds like it has gone past without hearing us, but then we hear the noise stop. We keep screaming for our lives until, a few minutes later, we hear voices coming towards us through the jungle. We start crying with relief. Six villagers reach us, drag us back through the jungle, and load us onto a tray on the back of a motorbike, with water and biscuits. We learn that they are from one of the jungle villages who were contacted to go out looking for us, which is why they were on the track.

I think by now it’s about 4pm. The guide has  attempts to explain what happened, stating that he has over a decade of experience in the jungle and this has never happened before. We tell him that we just want to go home. He starts off saying it’s not possible to get back to Iquitos tonight and that we will need to stay at the jungle lodge with him, but we won’t take no for an answer. We don’t trust him one bit with our safety. He eventually agrees to arrange for a boat to take us back.

We ride on the back of the motorbike for about half an hour, over bumpy terrain and occasionally getting stuck in the mud (it seems like this track hasn't been used in a long time). We are still being bitten by ants - my brother has hundreds stuck in his trousers. But we are all so thankful to be alive.

On our journey back, we learn that my map image was completely wrong and that it seemed to be a snapshot of my last downloaded location many hours ago. We also learn that the villagers on the bike didn’t hear our screams over the motor - one of them happened to fall off at the exact right time, so they stopped the bike to let him back on and that’s when they heard us.

From speaking to locals and looking online, it seems like this is the first time a guided tour from Iquitos has got lost in the Amazon.

We eventually got back to the office expecting apologies and compensation. Obviously, the money is not important at all when compared to our survival. But, to our huge surprise, the boss said we couldn’t get our money back because “it’s already been spent on the lodge”. We argued and argued and he eventually agreed to give us some in cash back now and another portion later to our bank account, but we won’t see that in our account for a couple of weeks and even then it would only be a bit over half what we paid. He basically called our bluff on bringing them to justice. He only gave the other two about half of theirs back as well. We ended up giving up as he was being pretty menacing and we felt unsafe, and just wanted to get the next flight out of there.

Of course we plan to write a bad review for the company but we want to see the money first, although might cut our losses on that. We just feel like it’s perverse that we were left to die in the jungle in extremely dangerous circumstances and it was completely the fault of the company that we put our trust in. They were severely negligent sending us with an incompetent guide without any supplies for the worst case scenario (which is what eventuated). It was an absolute death trap. We are still very shaken by the whole experience (this happened 4 days ago). And are also sad to have not had the adventure we dreamed about for ages.

Although we were still a few hours or days off dying of thirst, the scary part was the prospect of having to survive the night, or longer, in the jungle alongside all the horrors of the Amazon and still being no closer to being found.

One of our group videoed the entire thing. We are hoping to get the footage from her and can post the link once we do.

Any thoughts on what we can do are welcome. Thanks for reading!

——

My brother (21M) and I (27F) have always wanted to do a trip into the jungle, so planned an entire itinerary in Peru around doing so. We looked at a few different online tours, and booked a two-night tour leaving from Iquitos and going into the Amazon. The tour was one of the less luxurious options but had very good reviews so we felt it was a safe choice. We spent the days leading up to it in Lima procuring and stocking our day packs with safety supplies (correct clothing and gear, strong insect repellent, flashlights, medicines) and researching how to be safe. We were worried about lethal snake or spider bites, jaguars, caimans, mosquito-borne diseases etc, but the golden rule from all of the advice online was to always trust and follow your guide and you’ll be safe, as they know the jungle and will always cut a safe path for you and point out dangers. Thousands of people do Amazon tours every year and have a great time. We were really excited.

On the day the trip was starting, we met at the office in Iquitos and then took a boat for about an hour and a half down the Amazon river. The small group doing our tour included our guide (Peruvian \~35M but seemed to speak good English), a young girl who seemed to serve no purpose except to accompany him, and a mother and daughter (\~55F and 30F), the latter of which spoke fluent English and Spanish.

The boat made a couple of five minute stops along the way, firstly to get some gas and then to let some other guests off. It stopped a third time at about 11am and our guide motioned for us to get off. We thought we must be starting the tour so picked up our bags, but he told us to leave our bags on the boat. We assumed this was just another five minute stop. We asked if we needed our gumboots, and he said no.

We follow him off the boat. When we get up the river bank, he looks at our empty hands and asks “do you not have any water?” We were extremely confused as he had told us to leave our things on the boat and hadn’t explained what we were doing. He says “don’t worry, we are just doing a short 20-minute walk down the the track to a local village so you'll be fine.” The guide didn't have any water either. My brother and I are a bit concerned, but by the time we turn around the boat has already left with our stuff (including our water, carefully chosen repellent etc), so we trust that we only have a short period of walking and we follow the guide down the track into the jungle.

we were all extremely thirsty and were trying not to panic but things were not looking good it was extremely hot and muddy mosquitoes were flying everywhere and we were on constant alert for snakes spiders jaguars etc everyone remained extremely calm and thought logically which was a blessing the mother and i shared a hug i think she suspected i was about to get upset and we were so lucky to have the other two in our group but it was looking like we were going to have to try and survive the night or longer in the amazon jungle without water without a guide and without any of our supplies

the daughter then manages to get a bit of reception on her phone and can speak directly to the boss herself although we still have no way of describing our whereabouts we send him a screenshot of my halfloaded map image she contacts her boyfriend and tells him that she will likely die in the jungle and that she loves him but can he please contact the authorities asap we ask our guide what the emergency number in peru is and he brazenly refuses to tell us i guess because he was worried about getting in trouble so does his pointless girlfriend

we discuss our options including the risk of leaving the guide behind as he is still refusing to move or offer any advice despite our pleas we eventually decide that because the sun is going down and because of the risks associated with trying to get to the river we are safer trying to go back the way we came and at least find the dirt track which is safer from nature than the deep jungle and which also has a better chance of someone coming along the track and finding us my brother is confident that he can remember the way back im not the guide realising that we are about to leave him here on his own gets a new lease of life and we are able to heave him to his feet he stumbles ahead behind my brother and im at the back with the other three girls we are all trying not to break down

eventually dozens of ant stings later we hear a faint motor engine in the distance we start screaming for help at the top of our lungs to our dismay it sounds like it has gone past without hearing us but then we hear the noise stop we keep screaming for our lives until a few minutes later we hear voices coming towards us through the jungle we start crying with relief six villagers reach us drag us back through the jungle and load us onto a tray on the back of a motorbike with water and biscuits we learn that they are from one of the jungle villages who were contacted to go out looking for us which is why they were on the track

i think by now its about pm the guide has  attempts to explain what happened stating that he has over a decade of experience in the jungle and this has never happened before we tell him that we just want to go home he starts off saying its not possible to get back to iquitos tonight and that we will need to stay at the jungle lodge with him but we wont take no for an answer we dont trust him one bit with our safety he eventually agrees to arrange for a boat to take us back

we ride on the back of the motorbike for about half an hour over bumpy terrain and occasionally getting stuck in the mud it seems like this track hasnt been used in a long time we are still being bitten by ants  my brother has hundreds stuck in his trousers but we are all so thankful to be alive

on our journey back we learn that my map image was completely wrong and that it seemed to be a snapshot of my last downloaded location many hours ago we also learn that the villagers on the bike didnt hear our screams over the motor  one of them happened to fall off at the exact right time so they stopped the bike to let him back on and thats when they heard us

from speaking to locals and looking online it seems like this is the first time a guided tour from iquitos has got lost in the amazon

we eventually got back to the office expecting apologies and compensation obviously the money is not important at all when compared to our survival but to our huge surprise the boss said we couldnt get our money back because its already been spent on the lodge we argued and argued and he eventually agreed to give us some in cash back now and another portion later to our bank account but we wont see that in our account for a couple of weeks and even then it would only be a bit over half what we paid he basically called our bluff on bringing them to justice he only gave the other two about half of theirs back as well we ended up giving up as he was being pretty menacing and we felt unsafe and just wanted to get the next flight out of there

of course we plan to write a bad review for the company but we want to see the money first although might cut our losses on that we just feel like its perverse that we were left to die in the jungle in extremely dangerous circumstances and it was completely the fault of the company that we put our trust in they were severely negligent sending us with an incompetent guide without any supplies for the worst case scenario which is what eventuated it was an absolute death trap we are still very shaken by the whole experience this happened  days ago and are also sad to have not had the adventure we dreamed about for ages

although we were still a few hours or days off dying of thirst the scary part was the prospect of having to survive the night or longer in the jungle alongside all the horrors of the amazon and still being no closer to being found

one of our group videoed the entire thing we are hoping to get the footage from her and can post the link once we do

any thoughts on what we can do are welcome thanks for reading

Pic 15: Henningsvær

Pic 16: Verdenssvaet hike, near Narvik

We spent nine days in the area. Most of the stunning scenic areas start around Svolvær and progressively become more impressive as you go west towards the village of Å at the far southwestern end of the archipelago, with about 2.5 hours driving distance between them.

Some quick suggestions: 

1. Getting there: Most will first fly into Oslo and then take a flight up to one of many regional airports such as Evenes (EVE, for rental car), Tromsø (TOS, for rental car), Bodø (BOO, for ferry), or even directly to Svolvaer (SVJ) or Leknes (LKN) on smaller airplanes with more limited / seasonal schedules.

2. Good bases to stay in would be Reine / Hamnøy area, Leknes / Ballstad area, and Henningsvær/Kabelvåg area. These areas are central to many scenic spots and highlights. If you have the time, I would allocate 2-3 nights to each area so you can minimize driving time and explore each area in depth. 

3. Weather can be quite variable. We were there in late August and had many days of rain / cloud, but we still got to do hikes and outdoor activities every day as the rain would stop and the sun came out. Be prepared with good hiking shoes, ponchos/umbrellas and a flexible, open attitude!

4. Costs: The most expensive prices are for rental cars at $125-150 per day (likely cheaper outside of peak summer season). Gas was NOK 20-25/liter (approx. US$7.50-9.00 per gallon). Restaurant entrees are US$35-45 at upscale places and $20-30 at moderate places (no additional tax / tip beyond menu prices). There are decent groceries in larger towns such as Leknes and Svolvaer where food prices are moderate and many rorbu hotels have kitchens or kitchenette. Hotel costs are in line with popular international tourist destinations at $250-500+ per night.

5. Things to do: 

Stunning scenery everywhere you look. Nature lover and photographers’ dream. The two lane highway E10 that links the islands must be one of the most scenic drives in the world.

Outdoor activities— Hiking, with very high payoff vs effort ratio. Kayaking, fjord cruises, boating, and surfing / beach in good summer weather. 

Culture and history, where you can learn about Lofoten fishermen way of life, colorful rorbu cabins, stockfish production and salmon farming, and even the Vikings (the museum is on the site of the largest Viking longhouse ever found)

1f48sg1,2024-08-29 17:50:25,12 days in Namibia ,chokemypinky,"I spent a few months traveling in Africa with my boyfriend, and Namibia was the third country we visited. We were there from April 26th - May 7th. I love the desert so Namibia was incredible! The weather was hot but dry, low to high 90's usually. We did most activities early in the morning or late afternoon, too hot between 1-4pm to really do anything. We opted to rent our own car and self-drive, it was easy to do and definitely one of the easier African countries to take this approach. It gave us a lot of freedom to spend our time how we wanted (vs with tours), and especially during safari we could pick and could spend as much time as we wanted with our favorite animals (lions are kinda boring, give me more wildebeest! The drama). We never felt unsafe at any point on the trip. 

We spent 2 camping nights in Sossuvlei National Park, 2 nights in Swakupmund, 2 nights in Damaraland, and 3 nights doing self-drive safari in Etosha National Park. Each end was capped with a night in Windhoek. It was jam packed and all of it was great for different reasons! Didn't have a fancy camera with so a lot of the safari pics aren't as fancy as other peoples. 

Highlights included: 
- Enjoying desert sunsets at our campground in Sossuvlei. 
- Deadvlei was what inspired the trip, and it was as awesome as I had hoped. Crowds were not a problem for us. 
- Spent a half day doing looking for Welwitschia plants out by Swakupmund, extremely rare and can be up to 1500 years old. They're much bigger than I was expecting! 
- Desert elephant tracking in Damaraland. Saw a group of 14 elephants plus 3 bulls.
- Seeing a cheetah hunt in Etosha after being in the park for 5 min (didn't get the catch) 
- Watching rhino drama at the watering holes in Etosha every night. They're so grumpy and dramatic, its like Real Housewives of Namibia. At one point we could count 15, Etosha is def the place to go to see them. We did safari in five other countries and only saw one rhino (Kruger).

1i8h3s8,2025-01-23 23:18:31,China in 2024,azkxv,"Now that China has loosened up their visa process for a lot of countries, I feel like now a a good time to share some of my favourite moments from my visits in 2023/2024. It is by far my favourite country to visit, but as I’m more of a nature guy it’s hard to get short visits in. I detest the cities like Shanghai, which I was in earlier this month and couldn’t wait to leave. I’m a fairly advanced Mandarin speaker, which is extremely helpful, I wouldn’t be able to do 70% of the things I do without it. I do stick out like a sore thumb in some places as a foreigner, but people here bend over backwards to help you even if they seem a bit awkward or gruff to begin with, it’s just how they are.


I’ve visited much more than I’ve pictures, but I’m limited to 20 photos so I’ve just randomly selected the ones I like:

1. Huashan, I couldn’t capture the grandeur of this mountain range no matter how hard I tried. The cable cart I took there (take the expensive one) was the longest and highest I’ve ever taken by several orders of magnitude. Some opt to climb the mountain but they are missing out on a truly spectacular experience. If you’re adventurous, you can also the “plank walk” they have here, YouTube it.

2. Chongqing, although I don’t like cities much, this vibrant city was truly something else. It’s been pretty viral recently. One little thing I found quite surreal was going into a subway entrance and having to the escalator **up** to take the underground. 

3. Chengdu Panda reserve, in my favourite city, perhaps because it’s known as the “slow” city in China. Also the food is my favourite. 

4-5. Xian, an amazing city with so much more than what I’ve shown. The old city wall is so vast both in width and length that I didn’t include a picture just because I felt like it doesn’t really show the true scale.


6-7. Longmen Grottoes, 10000s of Buddhas dating back to the Han Dynasty 1500+ years ago. You can go during the day or in the evening like I did. Again it’s hard to me capture the serial in these ancient sculptures, which can be enormous like the ones I’ve shown or minuscule carved into rows along cave walls. Also this place is by one of the ancient capitals in China , Luoyang, which has a fantastic museum and ancient city.

8-10. Beijing, visited back in 2010 and it’s changed a lot since then. A lot busier and a lot of security, but the air has also cleaned up and there’s so much history to unravel. My favourite thing to do was walk the quiet hutongs.

11-14, Jiuzaigou. First pic was in March, second was taken in October, both the same lake. This place has something different to offer every season. If you walk a bit from the main path/drop-off points, you can be completely alone. I had some absolutely serene moments just listening to the rivers and birds. I’m only showing 1% of what this gorgeous valley has to offer.

15-16, Xishuangbanna. Like Thailand, but China. You can take the train to Laos from here in under an hour. Unfortunately I didn’t get to really dig into the local jungles and villages, I would love to come back when China opens up to foreigner driving licenses.

17-18, Yubeng. A gorgeous hiking range where I stayed for a few days in various hostels/inns around the area. You can see Tibetan pilgrims visiting sacred waterfalls, and shop owners shoo away Yaks who get too close to their customers/food. Again, showing 1% of what this place has to offer.

19. Lugu Lake. Home to a matriarchal ethnic minority. If you cycle round the lake you’re in Sichuan for one half and Yunnan for the other.

20. Yangshuo. Gorgeous karst mountains for as far as the eye can see. Also this place is very beginner friendly as far as China goes.

I’ve barely covered half of what I got to see, and barely scratched the surface of what I want to do. My next goal is to learn how to camp, and go hike around Daocheng Yading for a week or two. I’d also like to visit the golden snub nosed monkeys in a reserve where you can get up close in Pingwu.

ive barely covered half of what i got to see and barely scratched the surface of what i want to do my next goal is to learn how to camp and go hike around daocheng yading for a week or two id also like to visit the golden snub nosed monkeys in a reserve where you can get up close in pingwu a lot of the more interesting and esoteric spots in china arent easily researched on the this side of the great firewall but thats what makes china so rewarding","['china', 'china', 'loosened', 'visa', 'process', 'lot', 'country', 'feel', 'like', 'good', 'time', 'share', 'favourite', 'moment', 'visit',

Endless street harassment! For what it’s worth- we’re seasoned travelers who have been to over 20 countries, and coming from an even poorer country myself it was appalling the level of antagonizing we got while there!

To start of with the good- I have never seen anything as incredible as the pyramids, or the temples in Luxor. Like I couldn’t wrap my head around how something that beautiful and precise count have been made. Especially Hatshepsut temple. Definitely worthy of all the bad we endured. But holy hell, my partner and I were saying how, at the end of 4 days, we would never want to go back.

The usual camel hawkers and the knee selling junky items for 10x the price didn’t bother us. We got a tour guide which was fine but he went so fast. So we came back the next day on our own to try and slow down and enjoy. Well we were walking around and an official looking guy in a suit blew his whistle and was like “ticket”? To which already paid. He went on the whole spiel about how he’s a friend, waved us through , and then tried to push us through the”correct “ pathway. We followed and of course immediately cornered us and asked for money. Gave him $5 usd and he was like “give me more. I see another $5” to which we refused. To anyone who said we should have been smarter- there’s a ton of police around the pyramids, if someone blows a whistle at you, you stop and comply; you don’t expect it to be some scumbag.


The most egregious one was in the airport, we had to pass a tunnel to get to our terminal. It was really early so it as just my partner running around. An official airport security man asked for his passport (normal) where he was going , and at the end REFUSED TO GIVE THE PASSPORT BACK AND JUST HELD OUT HIS HAND EXPECTING MONEY. Said nothing, because he knew my partner was alone and would not make a fuss.gave him $1 usd bc he was holding the passport hostage and again he had the audacity to say, that’s it?


We had people follow us for several hundred feet to our car asking us to buy shit. That’s annoying as hell and out of sheer spite I refused to buy anything.  The whole dropping you off at some crappy papyrus/essence/stone store at the end of the tour put a really bad taste in my mouth although I know we could say no. EVERYONE was all “my friend my friend” but no one treated us with genuine kindness when we needed help.

We ran out of cash but only had a credit card-  no one at the bank would help. We desperately asked a restaurant- well they did, but at a 15% fee AND MORE TIP FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE on top of that. Knowing damn well the actual cash advance fee is 5% at most and they pocketed the rest.

Then they have their women and children monopolizing most toilets, handing you paper towels you didn’t ask for in one hand, hand out reached for tip in another. For effing paper towels that I can just get myself.


Unfortunately my pity for them is mixed with resentment and anger. Poverty is no reason to be dishonorable, that is an absolute insult to poor people everywhere.

But at the end I was getting terrified that we couldn’t leave, someone would extort us, and we’d be stuck in this country. At one point, we even drafted an email to the us embassy for help bc we were stranded without money (had lots of credit cards though)

1hg6kb6,2024-12-17 08:53:10,We spent a month in South Africa for our honeymoon. And we'd do it again. ,Crestmage,"Wife and I did a month in South Africa for our honeymoon this September. Covered the Western Cape, Kruger, and Garden Route with a total of 3 rental cars and 2 domestic flights. 

Excluding international flights, we spent $3500 per person for accom, food, activities. It was honestly the best decision we could've made. The whole country was just one amazing experience after another. Some highlights:

1. Table Mountain's flat top was surreal, followed by the sheer drop of a view looking down at Cape Town.

2. Staying by the train tracks in Kalk's Bay felt like being in a coastal town in Japan. Had fish and chips by the sea watching seals play.

3. Got to share a beach with actual African penguins, which was wild.

4. Did whale watching (right from shore!) in Hermanus, then an ocean safari where we lucked out with a 30min sighting of humpbacks, seals, and dolphins working together to feed. Our boat was right in the thick of it and was rocked the entire time. Pure fun chaos.

6. Stayed in a modern barn in Stellenbosch with amazing farm/mountain views. Did a couple of affordable, chill wine tastings too. The wife loved Stardew Valley and said our time here felt exactly like being in the game.

7. Surprisingly, driving. Roads are great and scenery constantly changes from mountains to coastline to wilderness.

8. Spent 3 days self-driving the Kruger in a Toyota. No schedule, no rush—just us stopping anywhere we wanted to, waiting at waterholes, and sharing the excitement of the occasional rare sighting. This was a perfect honeymoon moment.

9. Did a 4D3N wilderness trail (walking safari) in the Kruger. Had a half-hour standoff with 3 lionesses and 6 cubs, got close to a massive 400+ buffalo herd, and had to silently crouch and back away from some elephants. Being on foot was a way different experience than driving.

10. Stayed at a dreamy beach house in Wilderness. Dolphins during breakfast and miles of pristine beach. This was after our Kruger adventure and was a very welcome respite from all the dust, dirt, heat.

11. Bungee jumping at about $130+ pp. Felt safe and the guys there were absolutely pros. Got a very decent video out of it.

12. Did a small township tour in Plett. For those few hours we became proper tourists gawking at local life. It was...not pretty. But it gave real perspective on government initiatives and the uglies that many South Africans still face today. My usually-cautious wife was surprised at how much she appreciated the experience. Planning to do the bigger Cape Town ones next time.

13. For us, Tsitsikamma (Storms River) was hands down THE most beautiful location in SA. We stayed 3 days but could've easily spent a week there and still wanted more. The hiking trails were fantastic and well-kept. Our cabin's location was perfect—mountains and forests out back, Indian Ocean out front. A surprise bonus was seeing the Milky Way and stars at night.

About the elephant in the room...safety. With so many reports of murders, carjackings, muggings, etc. we weren't keen to appear on the news. I prepared a dossier of sorts with all safety tips and to-dos, memorized it then briefed the wife on the flight to SA. In general, no driving at night, keep to safer areas, no visible belongings in cars, etc. We were in our accoms by 7pm every night, except for one late dinner in Dullstroom (which felt safe enough). This worked out pretty okay as most days started early anyways. After a week all these precautions just became routine. We didn't meet any crime throughout our time here. Only hassle was some persistent vendors in Camps Bay.

For anyone planning a similar trip, September was perfect timing. Cold but good for outdoor stuff in Cape Town, great for wildlife in Kruger (daytime temps from 57°F - 95°F). This year saw a cold front all spring—at one point in Mpumalanga (near the Kruger) temperatures at night hit 30°F which was unusually cold for this time of year. We brought barely enough layers, but most places we stayed at provided heaters. Nights were generally very cold and we saw snow-capped mountains while driving along highways.

We mixed up our stays between Airbnbs, boutique hotels and guest houses, which I'd be happy to recommend. If anyone's curious about specific locations, prices, or activities, feel free to ask! Looking through these photos makes me nostalgic already.

TLDR: If you love nature, South Africa is a must visit. You get mountains, oceans, and safaris all in one trip. Hard to find this combo anywhere else, especially at these prices. Food, stays, and activites are super reasonable, and nice areas feel European-level comfortable. Only real issue is safety, so I'd prep some risk tolerance and LOTS of vigilance. Be prepared to make compromises, but imo few places offer such rich rewards for those willing to make the effort. We stayed a month, followed basic safety rules, and had zero problems.

who has asked for this why are we trying to make showers modern art i want four walls that close off i want to not be huddled in the corner of the shower trying to find the position that jets the least amount of water in the rest of the bathroom area where im about to spend the next  minutes getting ready and trying not to slip and fall on new sneaky puddles i want to be brushing my teeth at the sink and not get sprayed with the rogue shower head by my husband trying to find the right position too

We fly out of Italy and have a layover in Frankfurt before heading back to the states. We are wondering what to expect at the airport.

Any advice or info would be great, thanks y’all

EDIT: for everyone wondering if we intentionally did this, no. We traveled to Morocco for two days thinking that would reset our 90 days which we obviously now know it does not. Yes we were stupid and should’ve looked more into it before assuming.

UPDATE: we changed our flight to go directly from Italy to the US. It departs tomorrow 9/16 in the morning. I will post another update after going through security.

18yn810,2024-01-04 20:36:32,Japanese Stranger Jumped off Subway to Help My Daughter,DoomGoober,"While visiting Japan, my family was riding the Yurikamome subway line in Tokyo when my 8-year old daughter got it in her head the next station was our stop. She exited the subway car while her little sister yelled ""No, wrong stop!"" and everyone in the train looked. It took a second but my wife realized what was happening and tried to get off too but she was slowed by the packed crowd (our kids had gone to sit down, so we were separated a bit.) She shouted ""Stay at that station!"" A young guy by the door heard the commotion and jumped out the doors right before they closed.

Early in the trip, we had told my daughter if we got separated to wait at the next station and we would come get her. So, my wife got out at the next stop with my younger daughter and I rode the subway going the other direction back a station. 

Back one station, I saw the young guy standing with my daughter. After checking if she was OK, I bowed deeply to the young guy and said ""Arigato Gozaimasu"". But he was barely paying any attention to me: Someone else had gotten off the subway with me, the young guy's friend I presume, and they were pointing at each other and laughing. The young guy must have texted his friend to tell him to come back a station as he had unexpectedly gotten off the train to help my daughter.

My daughter told me she had cried a bit but then the young guy used Google translate to have her try to call me but she  forgot to dial the country code so the call failed. He then tried to take her to the station master but the station was unmanned. Then they just came back to the platform to wait for me.

The four of us (young guy, his friend, my daughter and me) hopped back onto the train going in the original direction again. I tried talking to the guy but he didn't speak English and we couldn't pull out our phones for Google Translate as it was too crowded and we were both holding stuff.

Thank you young guy for providing company and comfort to my daughter when she got lost! I feel bad I was unable to express my gratitude appropriately due to language barrier. He was very nonchalant and humble about the whole thing but it really meant the world to me and her. Travelling in foreign places, when your are most confused and lost, you meet the nicest people.

My #1 tip if you're planning a trip to Madeira: **rent a car**. I'm usually the type to just use public transportation, and I wasn't keen on driving on the island since I read it's kind of difficult, but now I'm so glad I did it. You could use buses to get to the most touristic spots but I don't think they are frequent or reliable enough. Just to give you an idea: on our last day on the island we no longer had the car and we decided to take the bus to Sao Lourenço because we wanted to visit again. The 30 min drive on the car turned into an almost 2 hour ride on the bus. The bus back to Funchal was 30 minutes late, and we had to wait in the dark for it to arrive. We weren't even sure it was coming. 

Renting a car is inexpensive (for us it was 30€/day with full insurance, manual cars were even cheaper but given how steep and winding the roads are, I would recommend against it. Big cities like Funchal can be a bit chaotic with cars parked everywhere, but honestly it wasn't that bad. Just drive safely and abide to traffic laws. 

**Regarding Levadas/hiking routes**: you have to pay a 3€ fee to walk them or you risk getting fined. Make sure you do so before leaving for the actual hike as often there's no signal up in the mountains. Also, pay attention to the weather report as conditions change rapidly and vary a lot from one part of the island to another and it can be very unpredictable. 

Don't try to squeeze too much stuff into your itinerary. Madeira is the kind of place where you'll want to relax and take in the views. ",124,5804,travel,"Madeira is a paradise for nature lovers. Five days on the island in pictures. Pic 1: Drive between Seixal and São Vicente

The geography is incredibly diverse—endless steppes, dramatic mountains, serene lakes, and even deserts.

Places visited:

 Altyn Emel National Park, Lake Issyk, Black Canyon, Lake Kaindy, Lake Kolsai, Charyn Canyon, Shymbulak (Hiked to Bognadovich Glacier in the Tien Shan mountain ranges), Ayusai, Alma Arasan, and did a city tour (Kok Tobe, Cathedral, Green Bazaar etc.).

We focused on hiking over city exploration. In Charyn Grand Canyon, most tourists stick to the 1.5 km top view walk, but we opted for a longer 6 km round trip through the Valley of Castles for a closer look at the canyon. It was hot, so we made sure to carry plenty of fluids, and the walk was definitely worth it. There’s a river at the end where you can rest under the trees.

At Shymbulak, we took the cable car to the second level, hiked up to the Bogdanovich Glacier, and made it back just in time for the last cable car at 5:30 pm. Out of many tourists, only about 12 others did the hike. The glacier was stunning, and we were thrilled to have seen it.

1fhylov,2024-09-16 07:14:02,12 days in Slovenia ,not_a_windowcleaner,"• Ljubljana (6,13,19). A very pretty, walkable city. There's not that many things to do, but it has a very relaxed atmosphere, and is a great place to do day trips from since the country is so small. I did a day trip to the Logar Valley (8) which was stunning, unfortunately I didn't get to cycle the Solčava panoramic road which looks amazing.

• Lake Bled (1,7,9,17). Best thing to do is to get up early and enjoy the lake in the morning when there aren't as many people. Later in the day it gets so crowded with people and cars! My favourite thing I did is hike up to the Ojstrica viewpoint for sunrise, its incredible watching the sunrise over the mountains. The view from Mala Osojnica further up is even better!

• Peričnik Waterfall (4). This was one of my highlights, the waterfall was so beautiful and a lot bigger than I was expecting! It was really impressive to walk behind it, and I also went down to the base of it and got drenched, but it was an amazing experience!

• Tolmin & Soča Valley (2,12,14,15,18). The water is incredibly clear and the area is great for ziplining, rafting, paragliding, canyoning etc. Kozjak Waterfall and the Soča Gorges are beautiful! I didn't have time to do the Vrsic Pass, but I'd say its a must.

• Postojna and Skocjan Caves (10). Unfortunately Skocjan Caves didn't allow photos, but it was genuinely one of the most surreal places I've been! The scale of the underground chamber is incredible, I thought I was in the Mines of Moria in Lord of the Rings! You can see the old path the explorers took hanging from the side of the canyon, I can't imagine how they must have felt!  If you have time, Postojna Cave is great also. It doesn't compare to Skocjan, but the undergound train is really cool, and the rock formations are crazy. It's a lot more touristy though.

Hey everyone, I’m absolutely devastated and just need to share what happened. My friend and I were super excited about our trip to Palermo, Italy—one of our much-anticipated stops. We got to our Airbnb, and our host was super nice, showed us around, and everything seemed perfect.

But when the airbnb hosts asked for our passport I went to car to grab it and I saw our fully filled back compartment completly empty. We’re now looking at a 9-hour drive to Rome to get to the embassy and try to sort this mess out.

One of our theories is that someone was following us around for about 10 minutes before we got to the Airbnb. They must have seen how full our back compartment was. The moment we parked, they smashed the window to pieces and grabbed our bag. The doors were locked, but that didn’t stop them.

I have no idea what to do. The stuff in that bag… it’s just so hard to even imagine it’s all gone. I’m at a complete loss for words right now.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? What did you do? Any advice on how to handle this would be so appreciated. We’re just trying to figure out our next steps.

1jdkyqn,2025-03-17 19:11:02,Turkey itinerary check - Izmir/Selcuk/Ephesus/Pamukkale/Hierapolis/Aphrodisias,An-Onymous-Name,"Merhaba friendly people,

I would like to ask you if my itinerary for a two-week holiday makes sense. Hopefully this post won't be too annoying for you - if there is a better place to ask this, please let me know.

This is a huge itinerary, you definitely don't have to read it all, my main worry/question is this:

It seems to make sense to fly to Izmir and then immediately go to Selcuk, to explore Selcuk a bit and to see Ephesus at opening time the next day. I >think< I should stay that day in Selcuk, and go to Pamukkale the next day, because four hours of bus travelling after four hours of Ephesus and one/two hours of the Ephesus Arachaeological Museum (and food) seems like too much? That means I arrive in Pamukkale around noon I figure. I hope I can find a hotel that can arrange a taxi so that I can explore Aphrodisias on that day (Aphrodisias won't be too touristy so I think it is fine if I arrive in the afternoon). And after returning to Pamukkale and staying there for the night, I can explore Hierapolis from early in the morning, and somehow (four+ hours of busrides? I assume this is possible?) return to Izmir. As you can see, there are many questions and assumptions in this - do you think this is realistic?

As for the itinerary:

Fly",1,1,travel,"Turkey itinerary check - Izmir/Selcuk/Ephesus/Pamukkale/Hierapolis/Aphrodisias Merhaba friendly people,

I would like to ask you if my itinerary for a two-week holiday makes sense. Hopefully this post won't be too annoying for you - if there is a better place to ask this, please let me know.

This is a huge itinerary, you definitely don't have to read it all, my main worry/question is this:

It seems to make sense to fly to Izmir and then immediately go to Selcuk, to explore Selcuk a bit and to see Ephesus at opening time the next day. I >think< I should stay that day in Selcuk, and go to Pamukkale the next day, because four hours of bus travelling after four hours of Ephesus and one/two hours of the Ephesus Arachaeological Museum (and food) seems like too much? That means I arrive in Pamukkale around noon I figure. I hope I can find a hotel that can arrange a taxi so that I can explore Aphrodisias on that day (Aphrodisias won't be too touristy so I think it is fine if I arrive in the afternoon). And after returning to Pamukkale and staying there for the night, I can explore Hierapolis from early in the morning, and somehow (four+ hours of busrides? I assume this is possible?) return to Izmir. As you can see, there are many questions and assumptions in this - do you think this is realistic?

1jdsmf6,2025-03-18 00:38:11,Uber in Dominican Republic,Competitive_Oil_6995,"Just got back from a long stay in Dominican Republic.  I wanted to share this information because I hope it can be useful to others.
 
Uber IS available in Dominican Republic!!

TL;Dr the drivers will usually want cash instead. Get the driver, agree on an amount, cancel the Uber so you're not double paying the trip. OR negotiate with both the Uber rate and a cash rate and increase your Uber rating. They'll give you 5 star if you ask. 

Here I what you need to know. Uber works great in tht DR. There are lots of drivers on the app. That said, 
- ""Uber Select"" in app, is the Tourist Taxi. It's 3x more expensive than UberX. 
- Depending where you are in DR, you might have other options, UberX, Comfort, Green, etc...  aside from XL, they are all the same. Don't think you're getting something better with Uber Comfort vs UberX. 
- More often than not, the way is works is, you order an Uber, the driver texts you and asks you where you are going and then comes up with some lame ass excuse about rates. (My favorite is they haven't updated the rates yet) 🤣🤣
- They essentially want more money and in cash. Once you are used to a route, just answer what you're will to pay and they will usually just say On My Way. It's like a glorified taxi hailing service.
- DON'T FORGET TO CANCEL THE RIDE WHEN THEY ARRIVE. If you've agreed to a cash price, cancel the ride and make sure he does the same and then cancel the request for another Uber.  
- You can bring it all up with Uber when you get home and get any cancellations fees refunded. For the moment, you're in a taxi with a pre negotiated rate!
- if you like the car and the driver, ask for their number. You may end up in a shitbox and the driver insists on give you their number.(Take it and toss it once you are at your destination) You might end up in something decent with a respectful driver. GET HIS NUMBER! You can Whatsapp him when you need a ride. You just ask for the amount and how long to get to you. This ends up being the most comfortable and cheapest way to get around.

Last note for the pro travelers!
.. there is another ride hailing service called DiDi. It's good I'm Santo Domingo but not available in some of the smaller cities. It's all I described above but the default is cash payment so no need to cancel the Uber. 

Hope this helps fello DR travelers!",8,0,travel,"Uber in Dominican Republic Just got back from a long stay in Dominican Republic.  I wanted to share this information because I hope it can be useful to others.

1jdrbiq,2025-03-17 23:37:03,Robbed at an Airbnb and won’t get personal belongings reimbursed,nab0nk,"I left the Airbnb to come back to my personal belongings stolen. The robbers also took the host’s expensive appliances. This incident happened outside of the United States. I’ve been in contact with Airbnb for weeks and they won’t reimburse me for any of the stolen items. There’s host liability insurance up to $1M under AirCover but that isn’t being honored. I call Airbnb multiple times a week and they continue to tell me it’s still under investigation or they give me a dismissive resolution to the case. They opened and closed my case twice now and can only offer a $500 inconvenience payout. I have a police report and list of items (~ $5k). 

Any advice on how I can escalate this and have them honor their AirCover policy? In the policy, it makes the host responsible for filing the reimbursement, but my host isn’t incentivized to get reimbursement for my items (I also think the robbery was set up, since there was no broken entry). I have a police report, list of stolen items with their approximate value and credit card statements showing I’ve purchased the item.

1jdqyhc,2025-03-17 23:20:42,My Proposed USA Itinerary,Confident-Sun-8291,"Hi everyone, I am planning a trip to the US April 2026.

Just a quick itinerary and wanted to know everyone's thoughts and if anyone had any ideas for changes or places that I should add. I'm coming from Melbourne, Australia for context and will be 20 years old at the time of the trip.

I will be traveling with 2-4 people, and am looking to stay under $10,000 aud, which would be about $6500 USD, per person, which in my estimated budget breakdowns I have successfully been able to accomplish. I also won't be able to go for more then a month, due to work and university.

A little background about me, New York has been my dream city since I was young and I am a big Boston Celtics fan and would love to go to a game in Boston so these two are a must. My partner loves New Orleans and is her favorite city, and she'd love to go, one of Orlando and LA is also surfacing aswell, due to her being a Disney fan. Although due to advice received, I think I'm leaning towards going in LA. .

So I would fly from Melbourne to Los Angles return, usually can find a deal every few months with Air New Zealand for around $800 USD.

So I would be planning to stay in Los Angeles for 4/5 Nights.

I would then Fly to San Francisco form Los Angeles and stay for 4 Nights, I know 4 Nights is a lot for San Fran, but would love to try get a Yosemite day trip in.

Then fly from San Fran to New York / Boston, whatever is the cheapest for flights at the time.

I would stay in Boston for 4 Nights, and New York for 5 Although the dates would be interchangeable.

I would get a train from one to get to the other, unless advised otherwise.

I would then fly from New York / Boston to New Orleans, and stay for 3 / 4 Nights.

I would then return to Los Angeles and Fly Back Home.

This would bring me to a total of 22 Nights, If anyone has any suggestions or changes I could make it would be very appreciated.

1jdj40n,2025-03-17 17:58:10,Best Way to Get to Portofino & Cinque Terre from LAX?,-SpaghettiCat-,"My wife and I have a future goal of visiting Portofino and Cinque Terre in Italy. We typically fly out of LAX, and I’ve been scanning Google Flights, occasionally seeing fares into Genoa (GOA) in the $700s–$800s. I imagine there might be ways to get better deals, so I wanted to ask for some advice.

I know the major airports in the region are:
 Genoa (GOA) – Closest, but not always the cheapest option
 Milan (MXP/LIN) – Bigger hub, more flight options
Pisa (PSA) – Closer than Milan, might have good connections

Would it be cheaper or more efficient to fly into a major European hub (e.g., London, Paris, Frankfurt) and then take a budget airline (Ryanair, easyJet, etc.) into Genoa or another nearby city? Or is it better to just book directly into one of the three main airports above?

Trains & Regional Travel:
For those who have done this trip, what’s the best way to get to Portofino and Cinque Terre from these airports? I know trains are great in Italy, but which routes or connections would be ideal? Would also be open to Ubers and found them pretty reasonable when we travelled around Nice, France in the past.

Other Stops Along the Riviera?
While Portofino and Cinque Terre are our main must-sees, are there other coastal towns in the Italian Riviera worth visiting if we’re there for about a week?

Really appreciate any advice or input. Thanks in advance for any help.",2,1,travel,"Best Way to Get to Portofino & Cinque Terre from LAX?

I live in the Netherlands (near Amsterdam), and a friend of mine is currently doing an exchange semester in Vienna. He invited me to visit, and it sounds like a lot of fun! I’m planning to go sometime in May. I’m flexible with the dates.

I’m struggling to find an environmentally friendly way to travel there. These seem to be my options:

* Plane (€300, 2 hours, no transfers) - Not eco-friendly at all.
* Train (€140, \~12 hours, 1 transfer) - Trains run on green energy!
* Bus (€110, \~24 hours, no transfers) - Not really a great option.

The train seems like the obvious choice, even with a 2-hour transfer. But before I book, I wanted to check: am I missing any other good ways to travel from Amsterdam to Vienna?

The prices listed are based on traveling on May 7th and returning on May 11th.",24,0,travel,"Amsterdam to Vienna in an Environmentally Friendly Way Hi there!

Hello all, I am 22f and I've never traveled outside of the US but I desperately want to. I have a few different countries I want to visit, specifically Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, and Switzerland, and I'm weighing the merits of booking through a tour company and having them handle everything, or do it myself. 

I would plan to go for around a week to a week and a half (depending on what time off I can get) and I primarily want to see geographical features such as Loch Ness in Scotland, the cliffs of Moher in Ireland, the volcanoes and glaciers in Iceland, etc. I also would want to see some cool architecture like castles. 

My budget would be on the lower end, but not super cheap. I really don't have a good price range in mind.

Are tour companies a good choice? Or are they a bit scammy? Are there any red flags I should look for?

I partially want to book it all myself because I'm a control freak, but I also think for a first time, it would be less stressful and smarter because I don't know what I'm getting into, but I chafe at the idea of having to stick to a strict itinerary. I don't enjoy being with a big group constantly either but should I suck it up until I've traveled some? Any advice?",11,1,travel,"Book with a tour or independently as a first time traveller?

Hi all!

I will be traveling in SEA for 12 weeks. I have a Lowe Alpine cerro torre 65:85 pack and plan to bring it. Since it will be on the bigger side of packs for this adventure, I want to bring a daypack as well. For walking around, but also for jungle treks, ha giang loop, day hikes, etc.

My pack has a detachable daypack of 10L. However it is too small for my intended use and also really floppy. I tried some compressible daypacks, but I would like something with a bit more structure to it.

I feel like I have enough space in my pack to bring something like Lowe Alpine airzone active 18, though it might be a bit too rigid/bulky. But the trampoline back seems pretty nice in hot weather (also it fits me amazingly)

Something less rigid might be nicer though, takes up less weight/space in my pack. Im looking at something like Lowe Alpine edge 18 or Osprey daylite. Though I worry about breathablity at the back.

Any advice and experiences are greatly appreciated!",7,1,travel,"Daypack inside backpack (bagception) Bringing a daypack inside backpack (bagception)

I have seen contradictory requirements on the passport validity - 6 months validity on arrival or passport should be valid for the duration of the trip.

basically our conundrum is what to do with the time weve allocateed for south thailand we dont want to do the island hopping thing because we think itd be crowded so my idea was to do one or two days in krabi for scuba two days in songkhla old townhat yai and then take the trainferry to georgetown in malaysia from there we would finish the trip in georgetown and kl before heading back home from kl

1jdauqm,2025-03-17 11:55:31,Transit through Cairo Airport Terminal 1,putokaos,"Hi everyone, 

I have a connecting flight at Terminal 1 in Cairo Airport, where I arrive and depart from the same terminal. However, I've heard that there is no transit area in this terminal. This seems odd to me because it would mean I have to leave the terminal and re-enter to get to departures. I have 1 hour and 30 minutes for my connection, which should be enough time to get through security, but now I'm worried I might miss my flight.

Additionally, I've been told that sometimes e-tickets are not accepted, and passengers have to pick up their tickets at the desk. 

Does anyone know if there are transfer desks available? The airlines are different, and I will be flying with Iberia to leave Egypt after coming from Saudi Arabia.

Can someone please help me with this?

My question is, what type of bag or suitcase should I use?  
In the past, I owned a two-wheeled suitcase that gave me back pain because it was too low for my arms, and thus, it was inconvenient to roll behind me.

Firstly, will I even be approved for the visa or is 9h too short? 

Can I withdraw cash at the ATMs in the airport or is it a bit hit or miss with foreign cards? Instead of faffing around with AliPay/WeChat (which I think I tried on a previous layover here but couldn't get it to work with my foreign credit card) so I was thinking of just getting cash out.

Otherwise, if this doesnt pan out, I'd like to stay in a hotel instead. Are there any hotels airside (in T2)? If not, I guess I'm also screwed since presumably if I want to go to a hotel landside I need to leave the airport thus I need to have the transit visa anyway? Or is there a way around this?

I'm an extrovert who makes friends fast, my goal is to go out, girls, more girls and a lot of drinking. I don't care what I eat or drink,I'm not interested in going to restaurant every day nor I wanna drink bottles of moet and grey goose, I prefer quantity over quality. I'm polite person and I behave when I'm drunk, not a type of guy who makes mess in other countries.

I prefered TH cuz of cheap clubs w party-minded people and no rejection towards foreigners. I wanna live my life a bit, meet new people and have a blast. But if I need to spend 1-2.5k I would rather go to SK, Japan or China. Any ideas? I've hit an wall fr.

It’s my first time here and I was thinking this city would blow me away. It has not. I allocated 4 days to this city and am on day 2 and have already explored/seen Chinatown, Haymarket, Darlinghurst, the Harbour, Opera House, Tower Eye, Manly (the beach), park, etc. This city is pretty, the weather is fine, and the people are nice. However, it’s a one & done city for me!

Reddit users tried to convince me 4 days in Sydney is not enough and that at least a week or more is needed here — I beg to differ. I’d say Sydney can be done in 3 days (including a day trip to the Blue Mountains). Although, I did not go to the Blue Mountains. I’m saying this based off how quickly I got through the main sites.

I don’t like to waste time sitting in my hotel room on vacation, but what more is there to do besides going out to eat?

Has anyone that’s visited Sydney share the same sentiment and if not, what did you do here that was the highlight of your experience?

FOR SOME MORE CONTEXT/CLARIFICATION:

Some of you in the comments can’t fathom the thought of seeing more than 1 site in a day. I’m not a slow paced traveller, and by that I mean I do not dedicate a 24 hour day to seeing ONE thing. Some of you would dedicate 2 weeks in Paris and spend it all seeing the Louvre. When I got to Sydney, my flight landed at 6 AM. That alone gave me a chunk of time to kill before checking into my hotel.

Everyone’s different and I’ve always been more of a fast traveler and that works for me. Key word “ME”. This is not my first rodeo! I’ve visited other cities & countries where I’ve had a very fulfilling experience in 4 or less days because I make itineraries as well as reservations in advance to ensure I’ll get to see/do what I planned. To those saying traveling to places to cross things off a list doesn’t make sense, uh? I mean, isn’t that kind of the purpose of having an itinerary when you visit places? To list or plan what you’re going to do and check it off as it’s been done and you move onto the next thing. Not saying that’s the SOLE purpose of traveling, but part of it is crossing places off your list. Bucket list sounds familiar, no?

3 nights Prague 

Overnight  train to Budapest 

4 nights Budapest

We like great beer and good vibe bars. Also into food (who isn’t). We tend to venture out of the tourist areas pretty much everywhere we go but of course we want to see the popular stuff as well. 

Coming from US If that matters 

Would you change up the time in each at all or does our schedule a lot a decent amount of time to see experience a lot? We are considering adding a day somewhere if it’s worth it. 

Thank you in advance. 

Update:
Thank you for the responses and it seems clear we want the extra time in Budapest.

1jcyoav,2025-03-16 23:19:15,SIXT Rental Car Put Me and My Family in Danger,MaynardGoneWild,"Posting this as a warning to anyone and everyone who rents vehicles when traveling and seeking potential advice;

  
My wife and I recently returned from a snowboarding trip in Salt Lake City, Utah. Upon pickup, an employee named Gideon upsold me on our Rav 4 pick based on a heavy snowstorm arriving on Thursday, 4 days from then. He said the Chevy Traverse had AWD AND better tires and would make for a safer trip for my family since we would be using mountain roads during a snowstorm. I trusted him and upgraded.

On that Thursday, we made it to the parking lot and the storm had already been going for a few hours. Even in the parking lot I was having trouble maneuvering in this vehicle. I thought maybe it has a snow/ice feature I need to turn on like my Subaru and I would figure that out before we left that night. We leave that night around 8pm. I spend 20 minutes trying to figure out how to improve the AWD feature, find an ice/snow mode and start heading home. The drive down this mountain road was the most anxiety I felt in my entire life. There were ""Traction Law"" signs flashing, to give you an idea of how bad the roads were. During the full ride home, I never went above 10mph and still I could feel my tires slipping at times. I had my wife read the owners manual in the passenger seat to see if there was anything I was missing, only to find out that this SIXT employee had upsold me to a ""safer"" vehicle that wasn't AWD, nor was it 4WD. He put me and my family's life in danger all for what must have been the most pathetic bump in commission of all time.

I was told a manager from SIXT would reach out, but still haven't heard a word and I've been back for 3 days. Seems to me if this was a common story amongst SIXT renters, there would be a basis for a class action lawsuit. If this employee is a one off instance, what should I do? I expect a refund on the upsell at the very least, but that doesn't seem like enough. 

If nothing else, I hope this serves as a warning to anyone here to never book with SIXT. ",37,0,travel,"SIXT Rental Car Put Me and My Family in Danger Posting this as a warning to anyone and everyone who rents vehicles when traveling and seeking potential advice;

im going to Guatemala in May and im stuck on where to go after my stay at the lake. I tend to get a bit bored if i stay too long in one region so i would like to go see something  else after my stay in Santa Cruz. My top 3 would be Flores, Semuc Champey or El Paredon - what would you suggest? my most important thing is it should be easy to get to from Panajachel/ Santa cruz. From those 3 whats the easiest to get to? I have already researched online but would love to get an unbiased suggestion from you.

Im from Austria so my spanish is limited but the basics are there.

May 5: land at 12 in GC - explore before dark 

May 6: transfer to Antigua + explore

May 7: Hike Fuego 

May 8: get back from fuego - maybe explor more if not dead 

May 9: transfer to Santa Cruz - explore town/ Chill at lake 

May 10: Day Hike - suggestion would be great

May 11:  Explore other town(s)

May 12: check out of hostel - transfer(?)

May 13: ?

May 14: ? - transfer to GC

 May 15: flight back to miami to visit fam

We are looking for a vacation with: many activity possibilities, great food, and a “reasonable” overall vacation cost. Drinking isn’t a main draw for us as we aren’t party animals, but could defintely enjoy some drinks here and there!

Do you think New Orleans would be a great vacation spot in this scenario and worth it for the money?

I am planning on taking a trip to Colorado with my partner this summer at the middle/end of June. Probably Saturday to Saturday deal. We will be staying with family in Fort Collins and will be doing activities with them but will have at least a couple of days alone. I’ve been out there several times and want some more ideas.

I’ve been to:
-Estes park
-Rocky Mountain (bear lake loop and up to Sky Pond)
-Denver natural history museums 
-Laramie, WY area and hiking spots

I’m looking for some outdoor activities for the both of us. We are both fit and want to hike but are from Midwest elevation so not looking to do a 14er lol. We have mountain bikes that we are driving out there with and have plans to hit some of the more local trails to Fort Collins. We are interested in taking one overnight trip to a spot that’s farther away, but trying to stick to day trips so we can relax at the end of the day. Thanks!!

I am currently on an F-1 visa (OPT period) and working in the U.S. after completing my master's (Aug 2023 – May 2024). I am taking paid time off and traveling from New York to Mumbai after 21 Months.

I’ll be carrying multiple electronic devices, and I’m concerned about potential issues with customs. The below mentioned items are all for personal use. (none of these are in boxes) Here’s what I have:

* **2 MacBook Pros** (1st: M1 Pro 16” 2021 – bought from Facebook Marketplace in the U.S - no bill., 2nd: Macbook pro M4  – recently purchased - I have a bill, both are unboxed)
* **2 iPhone 16e** (recently purchased, both are unboxed) - 1 for gift, 1 for personal use.
* **1 Samsung Galaxy A14** (old)
* **1 Canon R50 mirrorless camera** (recently purchased)
* **1 Xbox controller** (recently purchased)
* **1 Bose speaker**
* **1 HP docking station**
* **1 Logitech G305 mouse** (none of these are in boxes)

I want to know:

1. Will Indian customs create any issues when I arrive in Mumbai?
2. Should I declare any of these items, and if so, how?
3. Any tips for smooth clearance at customs?

Would appreciate any insights from people who have recently traveled with multiple electronics. Thanks in advance!",0,1,travel,"Immigration & Customs Advice – Traveling from the USA to India with Electronics Hello everyone, I need some immigration and customs advice.

I am traveling to New Zealand from the US I’m planning to stay for at least 5 months. I went ahead and bought bulk amounts of skin care and personal hygiene products, as well as some supplements I was worried about being available to me over there. It’s not like 10 of each item, but I was worried I might be flagged at the airport for checking bags that contain 4 sticks of deodorant, 12 disposable razor heads, and 4 bottles of liquid supplement (a few examples). As well as 6 months worth of my medication. 

I’m not sure if I am being ridiculous for packing so many items, but I’ve never been out of the US and i wanted to make sure I had access to the things I use daily. I am also a huge fan of Costco and I can’t resist a deal. 

Would this be a problem at the airport? Will they check my bags and remove the products? I also would hate to risk losing all the products and the money I spent going to waste. ",5,0,travel,"Packing bulk items Hey everyone,

From there we're planning til head to Iguazu Falls but we're beginning to second-question this plan. The reason being that afterwards we'll be heading to Salta, and it seems like a cumbersome journey from Puerto de Iguazu to Salta. I know everyone says that Iguazu is *soooo amazing*, but is it really worth it travelling that large distance to see some waterfalls? What is your experience?

Secondly, *if* we're going we plan on spending 1,5 days there. Arriving in the morning on day 1, where we'll see the argentinian side before sleeping somewhere in Puerto de Iguazu. On day 2 we'd visit the brazilian side before catching a flight from the argentinian side at 3pm going to Salta through Buenos Aires. Is that a realistic plan?

And does anyone have some kind of magic tip to travel to Salta from Iguazu that I haven't realized?

1jcqa3l,2025-03-16 17:10:26,Thailand / Vietnam Itinerary Dilemma,mycalvinz,"Hi! I need some advice… husband and I planning a trip to Thailand this October to visit friends that live in Bangkok. We have 14 days total, ~12 by the time we land in Asia (from the US). 

The loose plan so far is to have a few days in Bangkok, then rent a car together and do a loop of Chiang Mai, Pai, and Chiang Rai.

QUESTION: for the first weekend we arrive, we’re debating if we should go to south- fly into Phuket and stay have some beach / scenic time before going into Bangkok, OR go to some other neighboring country. We’re not major beach people, but I’ve always loved the scenery of southern Thailand or Ha Long Bay. I know Phuket/Krabi is super touristy and I’ve seen a lot of people here recommend skipping it… is it better to focus on 3 areas of the same country or to tag in something else close since we’re already out there?

Other options besides Hanoi would be Taipei, or maybe Indonesia somewhere. Idk, so many options and so many flights lol

2 nights in Zurich
	- On either end of the trip.  This gives us 2 nights and almost a full day to explore Zurich.
3 nights in Appenzell.
	- Half day in St Gallen on the way.  2 days of day hikes (Hoher Kastern to Brulisau and Wasserauen to Seealp).  
3 nights in Grindelwald.   
	- 1 day in town and 2 days of hiking (Schynige Plat to First and Eiger Trail).
2 nights in Lauterbrunen
	- Gimmelwald-Muren-Lauterbrunen and Manlichen Panarama trail hikes
3 nights in Zermatt
	- 1 day in town.  Hornlihutte and Gornergrat to Zermatt hikes.
2 nights in Lucerne. 
	- 1 day in town and the Stoos ridge hike (Klingenstock-Fronalpstock-Stoos)

For the other 3 days/nights, we were thinking maybe Locarno and Lugano, or Bern, or Montreux and Gruyeres.  Would love to see the cows, but I think we are going to be too early (we fly back on the 22nd).  

Any input appreciated.  We haven’t booked hotels yet, so this can all be reordered.

Thanks.

1jcop6y,2025-03-16 16:01:43,What are your personal rule sets when traveling ?,Secret_Act9000,"I’ve spent the last 5 years traveling extensively through North, Central, and South America. I usually stick to beach towns and large cities with over 5 million people. I focus on places with proper airports and solid infrastructure that make coming and going easy.

People in the U.S. and Canada constantly ask me about safety. The reality is, a lot of what they’ve been taught or sold about danger in these regions is wildly overblown. That’s not to say there aren’t scams, because there definitely are, but the risks are usually not what people expect.

Last night, I was talking with some friends about travel habits, and we started comparing the personal rule sets we’ve picked up over the years. I’d be curious to hear if anyone else has their own unusual rules or something they’d add to this list.

Here’s a list of my own. These aren’t universal rules, but they’ve worked for me in more than 90% of the situations I’ve come across. In some cases, I learned them the hard way. Some might seem extreme, but others I’ve talked to don’t think they go far enough.

**1. Arriving at the airport in a new country**

First things first, know what country you’re entering and what the visa or immigration requirements are. A lot of countries play loose and fast with the rules, and they change constantly. Some resort towns have extra tourism taxes. Some land crossings have tolerance zones where you’re restricted to a certain area for a number of days.

Figure it out beforehand. Don’t wing it. It’s up to you to know what you actually need and don’t need. A quick check on the country’s official government website usually gives you the most up-to-date info.

People get stung here all the time. “I’ve been to Cancun four times last year, this is all we needed,” and then boom, $200 USD fine because they didn’t get the proper FMM issued when flying into a different airport. It changes all the time. Know what they’re doing from the airport you’re arriving at, not from where you went last time.

**2, Taxis. Avoid, avoid, avoid.**

This should honestly be Rule 1. Taxis are the devil. Don’t think they’re your friend just because you had one decent ride one time. They’re not. There’s a reason this loser industry still exists, and it’s because it’s 100% predatory in nature.

This is where you’ll start to see how scam artists operate. I call it the “trap door” method. As soon as you walk out of immigration and baggage claim, you’ll be swarmed with guys trying to sell you taxis, rental cars, and shuttle rides. Walk past all of them. Never go with the first person who approaches you. Those are the worst ones. Trust me.

Go outside. Grab a water from a store. Have a cigarette if you smoke. Chill out for a second.

Next step, check if there’s an Uber pickup area at the airport. Some have it, some don’t. If they do, great, use it. If not, open the app and see where drivers are hanging out nearby. A lot of airports don’t let rideshares operate inside, but you can walk to a hotel, gas station, or store just outside the airport perimeter and grab one there. Hotels are usually the best option. If you see locals walking toward a highway or random curb, follow them. They probably know where to go.

Here’s my rule. I’ll walk up to 30 minutes from an airport to avoid taking a taxi. People think I’m nuts, but I haven’t been scammed once in five years.

If you have to take a shuttle or taxi, make sure you have a fare zone map. If there’s a prepaid kiosk at the airport, use that. Get a printed receipt with the fare and destination. In some cases, I’ve had no option but to take a taxi, so I’ll have them drop me off at a hotel that’s on the way, then I switch to Uber, Didi, or InDriver from there.

Taxi drivers never have proper change, never take the best route, and never accept credit cards. If they do, they’ll inflate the bill. Yes, paying in U.S. dollars instead of pesos at $1,000+ USD happens all the time. It’s not worth it. Don’t ever use a credit card in a taxi. Ever.

If they were serious about not scamming people, they’d be driving for Uber or using an app for taxis that facilitates payments online and keeps them accountable. They don’t want that because they can’t scam. Good taxi drivers in some cities actually do have this, but it’s rare.

**3. Booking Hotels and Airbnbs**

If you are new to the region, hotels first is the best bet. They are flexible, easier to check in and out of, and if you book one or two nights, you can figure out if the area works for you and check out some Airbnbs that are close by.

If you find a hotel you think is decent, read the reviews. Sort by most recent. If there is any mention of bugs, avoid. Any mention of internet not working, avoid. Any mention of cold water, avoid. One hundred percent of the time if it’s mentioned, it will become true.

As for locations, I’ve found better hotels closer to foreign countries’ consulates and places that are close to issuing immigration and visas. These locations tend to cater to a business crowd and have a constant flow of people and money to upkeep their properties.

When looking for an Airbnb, avoid anything under a 4.85 rating. Avoid anything with under ten reviews. Check the amount of stays and reviews. If a location has over 100 stays and a decent rating, there’s a good chance it’ll be solid.

Read the reviews. If a Karen type or American says it’s good, it’s probably good. People from America tend to be picky while traveling, so they scrutinize more.

Also, when looking at the photos of the location, a good indication of how good the property will be is by looking at the bathroom photos. No photo of the bathroom, avoid. Old tile or dated bathroom, avoid. New, funky tile, bright, good-looking bathroom is usually the best bet.

The profit margins for Airbnbs, especially in South America and Mexico, are great for the locals that own them. If they don’t have decent tile work or the place isn’t properly cleaned, avoid it. There’s enough money being made from running these places that those basic issues should be addressed, at minimum.

**4. Dinner, restaurants, drinks, partying**

When going for dinner and looking for food, if a place has a lot of people sitting there, it’s usually a good thing. Don’t be afraid of a 15 to 30-minute wait. The food and service tend to be better at very busy locations. If there’s a ridiculously long lineup at a street food vendor, that’s usually the best place to buy food.

Never go to a place next to a busy place just because there’s room. These places are usually worse than average, especially if there’s lots of seating. Great food places can have spillover to even one or two venues. If one place is packed and the spot next door is empty, that’s a red flag.

If a place doesn’t have a menu or immediately offer you one, avoid. Don’t ever go to a place that doesn’t have prices clearly advertised. It’s a massive red flag, especially with drink pricing. If you can’t point to it, you’re paying whatever they decide you should pay. Also, keep the menu at your table when the bill comes.

If a place can’t run a credit card, avoid. Any place these days that can’t afford credit card processing fees shouldn’t be in business. There are six-year-old girls selling lemonade who can process a card with their phone. Cash-only places are almost always run poorly.

Always try to pay with cash, but if they have proper bank-issued credit card machines, that’s okay. The more terminals they have, the better. Try to avoid paying at places that use clip-style card readers connected to a phone or iPad.

If a nightclub or restaurant has an elevator or difficult stairs to go up, avoid. If you can’t see the people inside and there isn’t a major touring DJ or band playing, it’s not worth going. Nightclubs pull this move all the time. It’s bait and switch. Avoid anywhere someone gives you a flyer, business card, or any kind of hand billing. Also avoid places with 10 random guys sitting outside—bouncers’ friends, guys on motos, dealers, etc. These places are trash. There’s a reason they need a team of promoters working the streets. Word of mouth has failed them.

Places with elevators and stair-only access are dead-in-the-water locations. A good nightclub needs flow. That’s how they make money. Any club or dining spot that requires an elevator is a trap door. You can’t leave quickly if you need to. It’s no different than being locked in the back of a taxi with a driver that has leverage over you. Don’t do it.

If the music is extremely loud outside or playing on an exterior speaker, avoid. Loud music gets people’s attention. Venues know this. That’s why a lot of them blast music on exterior speakers. But their understanding of how to run a proper nightclub ends right at the speaker. It grabs attention, but it’s a band-aid solution to a lack of word-of-mouth. The best clubs in the world use sound monitoring devices to play music at the right levels to optimize the guest experience. If it’s too loud outside, the inside will be worse.

If the restaurant or club has burnt-out light bulbs, bad lighting, uncomfortable seating, or dirty bathrooms, avoid. These are simple things to fix and are a reflection of the quality of food, drinks, and service you're going to get.

If they won’t give you the bill after one drink, avoid. Get up and leave. Clubs are notorious for this, bringing drinks fast and hard to pad the bill. Also, don’t ever buy drinks for locals you don’t know, guys or girls. Buying someone a drink or letting them sit at your table is a green light for them to run up your bill. It happens all the time. Sometimes it’s escorts, fichera girls, or even a random local girl who’s just hanging out. That sweet, innocent girl who swears she’s not on the take? She’s on the take. One hundred percent.

**5. Tours, boat rides, museums**

I don’t usually do much of these activities, but from the limited times I have, I’ve learned which places I would personally avoid. This one will be subjective, though. But me personally, I would never do these things.

Never go on a boat to an island or remote location. There have been people who’ve had good experiences, but to me, this is personally worse than being stuck in the back of a taxi, in a nightclub with an elevator being run by two bouncers, etc. This is the ultimate trap door, and I’ve had numerous people tell me stories of extortion schemes while trying to return to the originating location.

Same with any type of remote jungle, nature tour, or museum that’s located far from a city center. Local scam artists know this. Boats tend to “magically” run out of gas all the time. Shuttles “magically” have their valve stem missing and end up with a flat tire. Local police “magically” pull shuttle bus operators over and hassle the driver, but there’s “magically” a taxi driver nearby who can take everyone to where they need to go.

This stuff happens all the time. Your mileage may vary, but a good rule of thumb for me is: the farther you are from a major city center, the more likely you are to get scammed.

This is not to say that all activities are not worth doing. Personally, for me, there’s nothing that exciting that I would go by myself or as a tourist to check out. If there was something that I really wanted to do, I would hire a local to take me and have them pay. More often than not, giving a trusted local money and having them pay—or even just creating the illusion that it’s their money—can save you half the price and take away most of the leverage from opportunists.",53,11,travel,"What are your personal rule sets when traveling ?

never go on a boat to an island or remote location there have been people whove had good experiences but to me this is personally worse than being stuck in the back of a taxi in a nightclub with an elevator being run by two bouncers etc this is the ultimate trap door and ive had numerous people tell me stories of extortion schemes while trying to return to the originating location

same with any type of remote jungle nature tour or museum thats located far from a city center local scam artists know this boats tend to magically run out of gas all the time shuttles magically have their valve stem missing and end up with a flat tire local police magically pull shuttle bus operators over and hassle the driver but theres magically a taxi driver nearby who can take everyone to where they need to go

this stuff happens all the time your mileage may vary but a good rule of thumb for me is the farther you are from a major city center the more likely you are to get scammed

this is not to say that all activities are not worth doing personally for me theres nothing that exciting that i would go by myself or as a tourist to check out if there was something that i really wanted to do i would hire a local to take me and have them pay more often than not giving a trusted local money and having them payor even just creating the illusion that its their moneycan save you half the price and take away most of the leverage from opportunists","['personal', 'rule', 'set', 'traveling', 'ive', 'spent', 'last', 'year', 'traveling', 'extensively', 'north', 'central', 'south',

1jcoi8o,2025-03-16 15:53:10,Help! Overwhelmed by suggestions for Maldives,smut_troubadour,"Hey all! Solo traveler from the States (RIP) visiting Maldives for 4-5 nights in July (I'm a teacher, it's when I have time off). I have been reading so many blogs and reddit posts about how to stay and where to stay that the information in one (stay in one hotel and ferry hop during the day) contradicts information from the others (stay in four different hotels and ferry hop in the mornings). I know I'll get conflicting information here as well, but I am not sure where to start. I'm, obviously, landing in Male mid-July and have read that staying there isn't advised because it's mostly a landing spot. My plan was to find a hotel through booking in Hulhumale and stay there for the duration of my time while island hopping via ferry or speedboat during the day. Not against spending money when necessary but am not looking to break the bank. Does anyone have any suggestions or has anyone done a similar trip with recommendations?

My partner and I (both 30 yo) have been saving for this trip for the past years, and we are finally making it happen. We are planning to travel from Europe from early August to mid/late december 2025, with a budget of around **20- 25.000 €** each. Our focus is on nature, adventure, surfing, and experiencing different cultures. I speak good Spanish which will help.

We put together a rough itinerary, but we are worried it might be too packed. We could extend the trip into January, but I would rather be home by mid december. Would love to hear your thoughts, does this seem realistic for you? I ad the aprom. time to see if it is realistic. How about the budget?

1. **01.August 2025 Peru** (3 Weeks): Starting in Peru, spending about three and a half weeks traveling by bus through Lima, Paracas, Huacachina, Arequipa, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and Lake Titicaca.
2. **Bolivia** (1-2 weeks): From there to Bolivia for one to two weeks, visiting Copacabana, La Paz, and doing a  tour of Salar de Uyuni before heading to Chile.
3. **Chile** (2-3 Week): starting in the Atacama Desert, then flying to Santiago for a few days before heading south to Patagonia for hiking in Torres del Paine. Punta arenas, whale watching maybe? Should we skip Santiago?
4. **Argebtina** (2-3weeks), stopping in Calafate for the Perito Moreno Glacier, then Buenos Aires for a few days, and finally flying to Iguazú Falls before heading to Ecuador.
5. **Galapagos** (10-12 days): Flying to Galápagos, island-hopping before continuing to Asia.
6. **Asia/ Taiwan** (10 days) Exploring Taipei, Jiufen, Taroko National Park, and the southern beaches.
7. **Hong Kong** (3-4 days) and then flying to the

I'm planning a trip to Japan with three friends in August and September. We’ll start in Osaka and travel to Tokyo, stopping at interesting cities along the way (we’re still deciding which ones). After Tokyo, we plan to visit Kanazawa and then Okinawa, which means we’ll need to return to Tokyo at some point.

I’ve looked into the Japan Rail Pass, but it seems quite expensive, especially for a longer trip. So I was wondering if there are more budget-friendly options like night buses or regional trains.

I’d really appreciate any advice on cost-effective ways to travel around Japan. Thanks in advance!",4,4,travel,"Best and most cost effective way to travel around Japan? Hello wonderful people!

Our stats: 4 will be 17 yo, 1 will be 18.

I’ve flown by myself and know how to quickly get through an airport. I will be the one who ends up planning this. Two of my other friends are well travelled having been to Europe previously. The other two have never been to Europe and the extent of their travels is a resort in the Bahamas.

What we want to do: we are all pretty adventurous and would like to do something outside in nature and not just be indoors/ in an urban area the whole (hiking, going to a beach, etc.) we also like to wander aimlessly in a city or historical area and would like to experience local cuisine and culture that we wouldn’t find in the states.

1jciju6,2025-03-16 10:26:59,Solo trip advice to the USA,Ill_Store_4492,"Hi,

I (23M) am from Australia and am planning to travel to the US for the first time by myself in July/August this year. I’ve never solo travelled before (or really traveled much outside of Australia in general) so this is big for me. 

I’m planning on going for around 3 weeks and am wondering whether my rough itinerary below looks reasonable. 

Rough plan:
- 6 days in LA (Hollywood, Santa Monica, tours, etc)
- 4 days in San Francisco 
- 3 days in Orlando (Big Harry Potter fan and I know there’s a new Universal park opening up in May this year + two other parks there as well with Harry Potter worlds)
- 5 days in New York

I’d appreciate any advice on the questions below:
1. Is the above alright for 2.5-3 weeks or am I trying to do too much? Should I cut down on one of the cities?
2. I’ve deliberated on whether Orlando is worth it, given that there’s a Universal Studios in Hollywood. Does anyone with experience going to either have any insight on whether the extra cost of travelling to Orlando (flights etc) justifies it? As much as I’d love to see Orlando I’m worried about getting exhausted from all the flying and checking into new accommodation etc
3. Is July/August an alright time to go to the above places?
4. I’ve read that getting around in LA is difficult without a car. I have an Australian driver’s licence, but I’m nervous about renting a car since I’m not used to driving on the right side of the road and don’t want to risk an accident. Would I be okay relying on public transport and Uber, or is renting a car really necessary?
5. Is there anywhere else I should go to or swap out instead of the above?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you ",40,1,travel,"Solo trip advice to the USA Hi,

1jchosv,2025-03-16 09:23:19,Please help me check my logic for SE Asia trip,rsdfghj,"
I have about four months to spend in South East Asia, from early July to early November. I realise that it might not be when you’d traditionally want to be there given rainy season etc but it’s the only window I have unfortunately. I’m trying to work out how to best order the trip so we follow a logical route but also get the best of countries weather-wise as far as possible. 

I’ve come up with the rough route below based on the fact that Bangkok seems the easiest to fly in/out of, and also it mean doing southern Thailand and the Thai islands in late October/early November when the weather will hopefully be a bit better.

Early July: arrive in Bangkok

July: Bangkok, northern Thailand (Chang Mai, Chang Rai etc)

Early August: cross into Laos

Early August - late August: Laos

Late August-early October: Vietnam (start in the north in Hanoi and work my way down to Ho Chi Min City)

Early October-late October: Cambodia (Phnom Pehn, Siem Reap)

Late October: travel to Southern Thailand (think I might need to fly to do this)

Late October/early November: Southern Thailand (Phuket, Phi Phil, Thai islands) and work my way back up to Bangkok for flight back. 

I’m not wedded to this at all so would very much welcome any alternative suggestions, or if anyone can spot any major red flags in terms of weather/logistics. 

Thanks very much in advance for any comments",5,0,travel,"Please help me check my logic for SE Asia trip

1jcfb0m,2025-03-16 06:21:26,Itinerary Check: 3 Days Outside Baku (Gabala & Sheki) – Any Feedback?,Great_Two9991,"Hey everyone! I’m planning a 3-day trip outside Baku in early April and wanted to see if this itinerary makes sense or if I should adjust anything. I have a car and don’t mind driving long distances. Also, does anyone know if Diri Baba Mausoleum might have different hours during Ramadan?

Day 1: Baku → Shamakhi → Lahich → Gabala (March 30th)

* Leaving Baku at 8 AM.
* Shamakhi: Stop at Diri Baba Mausoleum, Juma Mosque, and Yeddi Gumbez tombs (should take around 1.5–2 hrs total).
* Drive to Lahich (about 1.5 hrs) and spend 2–3 hours exploring the cobbled streets, copper workshops, and mountain views.
* Drive to Gabala (1.5–2 hrs) and check out some of the sights based on available time:
   * Nohur Lake (quick and scenic)
   * Tufandag Resort (cable car for views, but only if there’s enough time before sunset)
* Staying the night in Gabala.

Day 2: Gabala → Nij → Sheki (with a Fortress Hike!) (March 31st)

* Yeddi Gozel Waterfall & anything in Gabala that I missed the day before.
* Drive to Nij (30 min) to see the Ethnographic Museum, old city walls, and Chukhur Gabala ruins (\~1.5 hrs).
* Drive straight to Sheki (around 1.5–2 hrs).
* Check in at Caravanserai Hotel and grab a quick bite.
* Afternoon hike to Gelersen-Görersen Fortress (\~40 min uphill, same time to return). Hoping for clear paths, but I’ve heard it could be a bit muddy in early April if it rains. Anyone done this hike around that time?
* Evening stroll in Sheki’s old bazaar and maybe a tea house to end the night.

Day 3: Full Day in Sheki (April 1st)

* Breakfast at ? I heard Gagarin Café is nice. (trying Sheki pakhlava).
* Sheki Khan’s Palace and the fortress area (\~1.5 hrs).
* Visit craft workshops (Shebeke glass, silk weaving).
* Lunch at Qaqarin Restaurant (definitely getting Piti and maybe Övriştə).
* Explore  Sheki Bazaar & biogarden.
* Visit Kiş Albanian Church (if I didn’t go the day before).
* Check out the Sheki Panorama viewpoint for sunset.
* Dinner at Serin Restaurant (any other recommendations?) before heading back to Baku the next morning.

Does this seem like a good balance of sightseeing and downtime? Also, would you swap anything out or rearrange the timing? Any other restaurant recommendations for Sheki? Would love to hear any advice!

1jcef3n,2025-03-16 05:18:56,A word of caution if you’re picking up a rental car after a late flight…,Inquisitive-Carrot,"I live in a spot where both my house, job, and the airport are served by public transportation. Which is great except for the flights that get in later than the last train. So frequently I’ll just grab a rental car, drive it home, and then drop it back off in the morning and take public transportation the rest of the way to work. I find it to be more convenient, and after almost having a driver slam into a line of cars at a stop light; safer than Uber. 

The other night I had a reservation for 11:30pm, which would normally give me plenty of time. But then my flight got delayed. And on top of that, United made me check my carry on (and I was group 4, what the hell!?!) so I had to wait for that at baggage claim. I wasn’t really looking at the clock because it was late and I wanted to go home. 

Pick up the car, get stuck behind some people futzing around for their ID and such at the exit gate, guy in the booth scans the key tag and I go. No problem, right?

Well…

My reservation was for 3/10 @ 11:30 PM. But I didn’t actually drive out of the gate until 3/*11* at 12:02 AM. So because it had rolled over to the next day, Avis counted it as a modification to the reservation and adjusted the rate. Which made me lose my discount and doubled what I would have paid if I had gotten to the gate 3 minutes earlier.

Was Avis interested in honoring the original estimate as a gesture of goodwill? No. No they were not. 

TL;dr: If you are picking up a rental car late, do not under any circumstances let the night flip into the next day; lest you get a nasty surprise when that receipt comes.

Trying to book inter-island flights, I am unable to book directly through any of the budget airlines we need to travel to our destinations (Lion Air, Thai Lion Air, Bakit, Super Jet). The websites will either not load at all past a certain point, or will 'ban' me for 'failing' a Captcha (it thinks I'm a bot).

  
Has anybody else encountered this issue and knows a solution? I'd always prefer to book directly instead of using 3rd-party vendors, but this has been impossible so far. I've tried clearing caches, going incognito, used 3 different browsers, different Wi-Fi /data networks.

I am considering a 10 day (or so, I'm flexible) train trip from Valencia to Naples, along the coastline in October for my Wife and myself. About 2000 kilometers. We have been to Barcelona, she has been to Rome. Other than that, we have no experience anywhere along that route. I have not traveled in Europe at all, really, aside from flying into a city and flying out again on business.

We are on a budget, but not extremely constrained. It's hard to say how much I can spend because I really don't know how much things cost. I could conceivably spend $10K USD on this trip, but I'd rather spend a LOT less than that and not have to live thinly for the next 6 months.

**Questions:**

Is there a universal rail system for travel in Europe that encompasses the coastline between these two cities, or will I need to research individual nations' rail systems?

Is it better to drive? (Maybe we can stick closer to the coastline than a train ride?) If so, what do I need to know about point-to-point driving trips between European nations? Maybe the train ride is plenty beautiful and I shouldn't worry about driving?

Is 10-12 days a reasonable amount of time to spend on a trip like this if we want to spend a night or two in a few key places like Marseille, (Nice, maybe?), Monaco/Cannes, Genoa, and somewhere between Genoa and Naples (not Rome on this trip)? I could extend it to two weeks, but I am looking for that sweet spot where I spend a bit less cash and still experience some great moments and food in these cities.

Other places along that route that are MUST see stops?

Tips for finding good private accommodations as close to the water as possible, when possible?

I am NOT a language person, I joke that I barely speak English! I will be armed with an iPhone, a notepad, and a smile. What language difficulties can I expect?

Is there a part of this trip that makes it a bad idea? If so, why? How would you change it?

Thank you.

1. Depending on the hikes (let's say the famous Pico de Areeiro), how should we be dressing? Assuming we would start early in the morning and into early/late afternoon?
2. Still on the hikes, what shoes should we buy, so we could use them on any hike?

1jbyrcm,2025-03-15 16:20:41,Traveling to beijing,zeltro_80,"**Irrelevant Context:**  
I'm finishing high school this year, so while planning my summer, I thought about learning another language. I'll spend part of the summer traveling with friends within my country, but I also want to do some solo traveling.

At first, I considered going to Thailand for a Muay Thai camp, but I discarded that option due to the number of gym tourist traps. I also thought about volunteering somewhere in East Asia (I'm Spanish and have been to a couple of European countries, but I'm not really interested in North or South America, and I’d rather leave Africa for another time). However, since I'm still a minor (17 years old), volunteering abroad is nearly impossible due to lack of experience and age restrictions.

So, my latest idea is to go abroad to study a language. Even though I’d prefer to travel to other countries, **Chinese is the only East Asian language I actually consider useful**, so I decided to go with that.

**What I need help on:**  
I'm looking for a **summer camp or something similar in Beijing to learn Chinese**. I'm Spanish, 17 years old, and planning to go for the whole month of August.

I’m not even sure if this is a good idea or if it’ll be a complete waste of time (I’m open to recommendations—read the context). My main goal is to **travel, meet new people, and experience the culture**. Learning Chinese is more of an excuse to make the trip worth it. Will be a month barely make any differences? If not I'll just plan other things somewhere else

Hope all you wonderful people are having a great day. My wife and I are taking an early 15th anniversary trip through France and I want to get some feedback as we’ve never been (outside of a 36 hour trip to Paris.) Im starting to think I don’t have enough time to do everything, but the time is all I can spare from work as I’ll have a new job. We are traveling in September.

Day 1 - Arrive in Paris from the East Coast - 8am. Go to Orsay, Notre Dame.

Day 2 - Marais, Sacre Coeure, catacombs 

Day 3 - train to Bordeaux, lunch then 2pm wine tasting at pape clement. Tour Bassins des Lumieres.

Day 4 - st Emilion. Church tour, trotte vielle tour and tasting, cite du vin in Bordeaux

Day 5 - rent a car and go to yquem. Drive to Cirilion du brave.

Day 6 - hang out at the pool, do a wine tasting somewhere in chatneuf du pape. 

Day 7 - drive to Nice, get on a boat.

Day 8 - nice / eze / bealieu sur mer 

Day 9 - fly home 

I’m struggling with how little time we have in Nice but then I also don’t know what we want to do. It may make more sense to take another day in CDP or just to shorten that and spend the time in Nice vs doing 2 nights in each location. 

The flights are booked, but none of the hotels are yet. 

There looks like there’s a ton to do, the weather should be fantastic and I think it’s going to be hard to have a bad time but would love some feedback from those that have done this before.

Thank you!

**Dec 13-14** \- Exploring Cusco and adapting to altitude  
**Dec 15-17** \- Ayahuasca retreat in Sacred Valley

**Dec 26** \- Travel to Huacachina   
**Dec 27** \- Nazca Lines and travel to Lima  
**Dec 28** \- Lima

**Dec 29** \- Travel to La Paz  
**Dec 30** \- Lake Titicaca and Isla de Sol  
**Dec 31** \- Isla de Sol and return to La Paz, NYE in La Paz

**Jan 1-Jan 3** \- Uyuni Salt Flats Tour  
**Jan 4** \- Travel to Rurrenabaque

**Jan 5-Jan 7** \- Amazon Tour

**Jan 8 -** return to Lima  
**Jan 9** \- Travel back to Europe

  
What do you think? We dont mind if the tempo is intense, my main concern is that 2 of our tours that we plan to take organised (Colca Canyon and Uyuni) fall either on Christmas or NY, so I am a bit worried the tours will not take place on those dates.

1jbswv9,2025-03-15 11:18:29,Travel Friends who don’t buy data…,Either_Affect_6972,"I just wanted to get some feedback, or maybe I just wanna vent?

Anytime I travel overseas, I will either get an eSIM, a physical SIM, or the roaming package from my phone provider.   I do this so that I have data wherever I go, which would allow me to look up an address, use a map for directions, make a restaurant reservation, check opening hours, etc. when I am not somewhere that has Wi-Fi.

It drives me a little nuts when I’m travelling with a friend who refuses to get a data package of some kind. And who insists that they will simply use Wi-Fi whenever they have it. The reality is they rely on my data. 

Does anybody else have the same experience? Do I just need to take a Valium?

EDIT: when I say that they rely on my data, what I mean is that they will say to me hey, you have data, can you look up? What are the operating hours of this museum, or when is the next bus coming? They’re not asking me out for a hotspot. So I am doing the work plus using my data… and yep, I guess I can be clear about my own boundaries when it comes to this and I guess if it is a dealbreaker, I will let my travel partners know upfront :-)

Further edit.:  I am Canadian and roaming costs C$16 per day, which is about US$10 per day. For a week vacation that adds up a lot. I suppose once we are the 51st state I’ll have access to some amazing cell phone plans :-) 🤮",232,369,travel,"Travel Friends who don’t buy data… I just wanted to get some feedback, or maybe I just wanna vent?

1jbngxx,2025-03-15 04:46:31,Help me pick one more location to stay in Bali,busylilmissy,"My husband and I are going to Bali for 9D/8N at the end of May/beginning of June.

We’ve decided that the second location will be Ubud for the greenery and the close proximity to a few popular tourist activities. The last 4 nights and third location will coincide with our anniversary so this is where we’ll splurge on a nice villa in Amed and just spend our days relaxing by the water and enjoy quality time together. 

The first location is what we are having trouble deciding on. It seems like we should take that opportunity to stay somewhere in the south, especially since that’s where we’ll fly into. But every place I look at in the south just seems… unappealing. We’re not partiers, we don’t want to go to clubs, we don’t want to eat at western restaurants, we won’t be surfing, we don’t plan to do much shopping, etc. On top of that, so many people online advise to get out of the south where it’s overrun with tourists.

I am trying to figure out which Tulou houses are the best to visit. There are so many spread in that region. That is, which are the most interesting ones, but not necessarily the most crowded?

And another question would be: Is there a possibility to go from that area straight to Shenzen or is it necessary to go back to Xiamen and take the train from there?

Thank you very much.

1jbivud,2025-03-15 00:33:13,Frankfurt Airport Nightmare,throwawayhoe9,"After this happened to me (26f at the time), I tried searching around this issue, but couldn’t really find anything related to my specific problem aside from throwaway gaslighty comments, brushing this kind of thing off (but found many other problems people experienced with Frankfurt).

I flew via Frankfurt with my sister last year on our way back from Egypt (we flew there via München which was a far more comfortable experience). Now my sister has only flown once before so this was her first transit and I was trying my best to make sure she got everything right for the security check. So much so, I forgot to remove my belt. This obviously flagged in the machine and I was taken aside to be patted down. Because we’d flown from Egypt, I was expecting a similar kind of pat-down as to what had happened there (which I found to be dignified, respectful, yet thorough), but this was not the case.

I flew via Frankfurt with my sister last year on our way back from Egypt (we flew there via München which was a far more comfortable experience). Now my sister has only flown once before so this was her first transit and I was trying my best to make sure she got everything right for the security check. So much so, I forgot to remove my belt. This obviously flagged in the machine and I was taken aside to be patted down. Because we’d flown from Egypt, I was expecting a similar kind of pat-down as to what had happened there (which I found to be dignified, respectful, yet thorough), but this was not the case.

1jbin0j,2025-03-15 00:21:06,24 Hours to spend in LaGuardia area!,JusMeJim,"I'm going to be flying into LaGuardia Sunday March 23 right around noon. I'm thinking my return flight will be around noon on Monday the 24th, so I'll have right around 24 hours to spend in that area. I don't really want the hassles of renting a car and dealing with the NY traffic.

So my question is this. I'm looking for a budget friendly (but decent) hotel in the area. Just a place to sleep. Somewhere to have a nice meal in the area, maybe within walking distance of the hotel. Steak, NY style pizza, Chinese (maybe buffet).

I'm not a drinker, but wouldn't mind finding some late night entertainment....maybe live music or something? Any thing special to do Monday before the flight leaves in the area?

I'll be traveling extremely light. Not even a change of clothes. Just a small bag with for toiletries so I won't have to worry about a suitcase.

Is the area even safe enough to be walking around in for an older guy?

1jbgbsk,2025-03-14 22:32:58,What neighborhoods/general areas to stay in Berlin,Catbussed,"Hello,

Tried searching around for good answers but some things are a couple years old and wanted to get some possible up to date information/advice

I will be visiting Berlin for a weekend in August and wanted to get some ideas on areas to stay. I am traveling with my partner, and it will be our first time there.

As an aside, we are interested in the following things:

* museums-art, history (would love to visit private galleries too, if that is a thing)
* general history (low hanging fruit but for example the Berlin Wall)
* coffee shops, cafes, vintage shops, good food varieties
* I noticed there are a lot of parks so we'd love to have good access to good parks

In my research online, I've found people recommending Prenzlauer Berg, Hackescher Markt, and Friedrichshain as good areas to stay at. I've also been looking at the location where the [Hotel Luc](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Luc,+Autograph+Collection/@52.5161254,13.3868306,15.42z/data=!3m1!5s0x47a851dae305d99d:0xd828c3d3582ddfc4!4m20!1m8!3m7!1s0x47a851e0ce50d3fb:0x69ec81cf4ec66f34!2sHackescher+Markt,+10178+Berlin,+Germany!3b1!8m2!3d52.5237159!4d13.4022679!16s%2Fg%2F1tt1rqsd!3m10!1s0x47a851dae35ffc41:0x2059e3d3a52ca2ab!5m4!1s2025-08-02!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d52.514489!4d13.390907!16s%2Fg%2F11j1hx9rnc?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) is located (is this downtown?)

So--all this to say: what part of Berlin should I stay at?

1jbc7x1,2025-03-14 19:34:56,Second Time in Egypt,CE-85,"Back in 2018, we had an extensive roadtrip in Egypt including Cairo, Luxor, Aswan and many other interesting places but didn't have the chance to see Saqqara and Dahshour. In january this year, I decided to go back and see the rest of the pyramids! We spent four full days in Cairo. It was a blast honestly. I had a better experience than the previous one because there seemed to be way more tourists than 2018 which meant all those annoying ""sellers"" had to divide their attention so they didn't really bother me all that much. To sum it up:

* Giza was way way way too crowded. We went there first thing in the morning and still got caught up in the mass.
* After half a day in Giza, we visited the new museum for another half a day. There is like a food court in the museum for lunch and it turned out to be very convenient to spend the entire day around Giza. I would say Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) is a total success even though not all the rooms were open yet.
* Saqqara and Dahshour were pretty much empty. We hired a car with a driver for the entire day from our hotel and it worked out great. I really loved that day! There is enough to see and spend the whole day.
* We entered all the open pyramids in all three sites. It's a real physical challenge to climb down to the end. You go through very small corridors and they are dampy, stuffy, smoky... you end up sweating like you are in a sauna. As an active and fit (but also very tall) person, I struggled a little bit. I don't know how many times I hit my head or my back because you are practically crawling your way down and then up. Some pyramids took like 10 minutes one way. So be aware because nobody warns you and I could see that some people REALLY had a terrible time and blocked others.
* For the Islamic Cairo (old town) part, we started walking from Bab al-Futuh up until the Citadel and it took an entire day. We entered any place with a ticket and loved every minute of it. Super beautiful architecture!
* On top of GEM, we went to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC) to see the mummies. They had a fantastic collection of mummies over there and the rest of the museum is also quite interesting. If you want to see the treasures of Tutankhamen, you must go to the original Egyptian Museum (EM) in Tahrir Square. So the holy trinity is only complete if you visit all these three museums: GEM, NMEC & EM. It takes more time and money this way but I understand the logic behind it. It pushes tourists to... well... spend more time and money in Egypt :)
* We also had short and interesting visits to the Coptic Cairo and the El-Gamaleya (City of the Dead) parts which we loved.

I'm probably missing some stuff because I'm writing this report after two months but that's about it. It was mostly a pleasant visit.

1jbcrzw,2025-03-14 19:58:39,Anyone flown Manchester-Seoul via Shanghai with Juneyayo Airlines?,Administrative-Can2,"So I’m flying from MAN to ICN via PVG (Shanghai Airport).

First leg is with Juneyayo Airlines, second with Asiana. 
I was trying to figure out how to check-in for the second leg, as Asiana offers no mobile boarding pass for Shanghai, so I asked them if I need to leave the transit area and check-in at the desk.
However, they just referred to Juneyayo.

Turns out, the whole itinerary is done by Juneyayo, Asiana only operate the second flight. Turns out they got a codesharing agreement, from what I’ve seen researching.

Since Juneyayo don’t answer any mails, I got the following question to those having taken the same or similar flight: 

How does Check-in work for the second leg? I know Juneyayo offer no online check-in, so I need to check in at Manchester which is fine. But do I get the boarding pass for both flights or only the first one? If only for the first one, do I need to leave the transit area in Shanghai (which would be a little bit of a hassle) or is there a transit desk I can go to even if it’s done by two different airlines technically? 

I got no baggage other than carry on.

Thank you for you help in advance!

1jbcqia,2025-03-14 19:56:51,Volaris/ timing,GuacCat,"Hi! 

Planning a trip to Guatemala to visit family in November and wanted to get some input on if  my current outbound flight plan seems feasible.

SMF-LAX with Delta landing at 6:53pm.
Flight with Volaris departing LAX at 10:07pm to GUA.

Return is through United from SMF-GUA


I know Volaris is very hit and miss so I wanted to get some feedback on that, and make sure this leaves enough time for the second flight? It looks like the terminals in LAX are close together. Planning on only traveling with a carry on, so no checked bag. 

Flying this way is about $300 cheaper than booking a round trip flight so it seems worth it to me, but not sure if there’s too much risk with Volaris.

Thanks!

1jawqrv,2025-03-14 05:30:12,Detailed China Trip Report - 8 Days in Shanghai and Beijing,Confused_Firefly,"I'm just coming back from a little over a week in China, so here's my honest trip report about my experience :) As a premise, I am autistic, and that has definitely influenced things. 

***TL;DR:*** It was absolutely lovely, and also very overwhelming 

***Day 1:*** I arrived in Shanghai relatively late in the evening. For the sake of trying something new, I took the maglev to the city and then the metro to my hostel. My local friend had warned me about the metro having security checks, but they were overall very easy to get through, barely a few seconds. The metro was easy to use and efficient, as expected from the biggest metro railway system in the world! If you have ever taken the underground before, you're hard-pressed to get lost in Shanghai. 

Generally, I found the city to be more familiar than I expected. Having been to Tokyo and Seoul, I was expecting something along the same lines, but it was closer to being in Milan. Less curated, less bright, more chaotic, a lot dirtier. 

***Day 2:*** Honestly, I only visited Shanghai to meet up with a local friend. Not being in the mood for shopping, we just entered the first museum we found, the **Shanghai Sports Museum**. It has a mix of art, history of sports in Shanghai, and relics from the Olympics, incl. costumes, mascots, and torches. As someone who doesn't care much about sports, I wouldn't go back, but it's well made, and I'd recommend it to those that might enjoy the theme. 

We then visited one of the very few places I actually wanted to see - the **Propaganda Poster Art Centre**. It's a lovely little collection of propaganda posters, as well as some vintage advertisements in a separate room. If you have any sort of interest in history or design, I heavily recommend it - it's gorgeous, and it really showcases the depth of propaganda, which goes far beyond praising the CCP (although certainly not lacking in that aspect). Regardless of one's personal opinions on the subject matter, it's a great way to spend half an hour. There is also a lovely, but unfortunately a bit overpriced, gift shop. 

Under recommendation from my friend, we then went to feed the pigeons at **People's Park**. I was expecting it to be a mess, but the pigeons are gorgeous, tame, and very used to feeding. The food you can purchase is also healthy for them (seeds), and they get regularly fed from the people at the park, so they're very happy birds. 

***Day 3:*** We went to **Zhujiajiao**! It took around two hours with public transport, but I honestly didn't mind it at all. Again, the metro was very easy to use. 

Zhujiajiao is touristic, for sure, but I felt like that added to the experience. It's not trying to be a pristine historical town; more a great blend of traditional and a little kitchyness, just enough to be relaxing and entertaining for families. There's plenty of food to try and trinkets to buy, and if you stray from the main canal, there's even more to see. You can also walk right into some of the more residential areas, which are far quieter. 

Right outside of the main canal area you'll also find banks, fast food chains, and convenience shops, so if you have a problem with AliPay, like I did, you will be able to find an ATM \*facepalm\* There we also tried Mongolian-style tea, which deserves an honorable mention in my book for being delicious, cheap, coming with a nice snack platter, and mostly being served by a lovely grandma in a comforting little shop.   
  
***Day 4:*** I planned to wake up early and go to Suzhou, to beat the weekend crowds and see the gardens and a couple of museums. Due to a migraine, that wasn't possible, so I stayed in instead, and in the afternoon I walked around Shanghai by myself. 

First, I went to visit the **Marriage Market** in People's Park, held every weekend. Being able to read some of the announcements made the whole experience more fun, since I went around trying to find people with specific characteristics as a personal game. The folks seemed to be having fun, and it was overall a good atmosphere, bustling with activity. 

**The Bund** was not on my initial list of things to see, but I had time to spare. As a European, I found it to be exactly what I expected - just another fancy city center. Personally, I could've skipped on it without feeling like I was missing anything at all, but I see the appeal for those who might not be familiar with the architecture. The iconic skyline was a nice sight, though, and there were plenty of families having a nice Sunday out. 

Lastly, I decided to visit **Shanghai Circus World**. I love performance and performance arts, but it's been years since I've last been to a proper circus. The show was well-choreographed and quite lovely, although I felt that it could be a bit more polished; while most of the performance was impressive, a couple of the acrobats missed their jumps more than once.   
  
***Day 5:*** I took the train to Beijing; I wanted to explore the art district, the crowds at the station were so overwhelming I had to spend the rest of the afternoon in my hotel room recuperating. Since my hotel was facing **Qianmen Street**, I had a nice walk in the evening and enjoyed the lively atmosphere. 

Be warned that the high-speed train experience is much like an airport: many document and security checks, and waiting at a gate to board your train, instead of just walking onto the platform and boarding, like I was used to, so definitely show up early. 

***Day 6:*** One of the activities I was most looking forward to: visiting the **Great Wall**. My original plan was to go at Badaling, since it was accessible by public transport, and I wasn't sure that **Mutianyu** would be in low season, but in the end I had a last-minute change of heart and booked a tour with Mubus. I am not a tour person, but they mostly provided transport, tips, and food, and we were left to explore on our own, which is exactly what I wanted. I am not sponsored in the slightest, but I had a great experience and would absolutely use them again. Zhili and Heili, our guides, were bright, fun, and helpful. I'd also spring for the meal again, it was delicious. 

Mutianyu was also a great choice: by 14-ish, it was almost empty. With a couple of people I met on the bus, we decided to take the cable car up the East Route, walk to Tower 1, then walk all the way to 20, and back to 6 for the toboggan. We would've hiked up, too, but we were advised that we wouldn't have enough time. I am not too much in shape, and the stairs were a lot steeper than I could've imagined - some sections, I had to climb with my hands, as well. I made it the length-and-a-half we decided on, but my legs have been punishing me for it ever since, so consider your shape :') If you have to pick a route, I found the West Route to be both easier and more impressive. 

The toboggan down was something I really wanted to do, and it was exhilarating for the first 100m or so; then, I reached the people below, who were proceeding at a snail's pace. Honestly, if there is almost no one else, I'd do it, bit otherwise, I would skip. 

***Day 7:*** Another one of my long-held goals: the **Forbidden City**. I was looking forward to it, and my hotel was perfectly placed. Beijing is built on a grid - it should have, by all means, been easy to walk there. It took over two hours, because the city center seems to have decided no one is allowed to cross the street anywhere. I would get somewhere, and then be sent in the complete opposite direction, because I wouldn't be allowed there. The guards' indications ranged from very helpful (a young man took out his phone to translate precise directions for me) to the absolutely unhelpful (guy literally playing League of Legends on his phone and barely pointing in a given direction). 

Eventually I made it, but I learned my lesson: next time, take the metro. Seriously. It would've take a fourth of the time, and probably avoided me enough stress to not ruin the next couple of days.

The Forbidden City is impressive. We spent almost all day there, and we still probably missed on a lot. Plenty of lovely artifacts all around. I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said: it's absolutely great if you enjoy museums. It was, however, very crowded, even on a weekday in low season, so I definitely don't want to see how it would be on a weekend in the summer. Honorable mention to the incredible amount of gift shops, all well-organized and with a very, very wide price range. The merch was lovely, and I wish I had gotten a couple more things that I did, in retrospect, because they seemed very well-made. 

I planned to visit the Summer Palace afterwards, but the morning odyssey had exhausted me, so I pushed it for the next day. 

***Day 8:*** Once again, not a day that went according to plan. I wanted to visit the National Museum, briefly see Tiananmen Square, and then visit the Summer Palace that I hadn't been able to visit the previous day. 

This time, with the metro, getting there was easy, but the **National Museum** was crowded, and with the accumulated stress, I couldn't continue past the first floor. I think this won't be a problem for more neurotypical folks, but I ended up in a corner trying to breathe, and inevitably went back to spend the rest of the day in. 

I did see **Tiananmen Square** on my way out; it was spacious enough that I felt like I could stop for a few minutes. If it were an open square, it could be an amazing center of city life. Unfortunately, it requires a reservation to enter and several checks, and as a simple tourist destination, it's... Empty, without locals hanging around. I have also seen many security cameras in China, but never quite as many as here. Overall, I found it to be mostly a display of government control. Still, many domestic tourists seemed very glad to be there. 

***Day 9:*** Flight back home, with a quick layover in Shanghai.

***Day 7:*** Another one of my long-held goals: the **Forbidden City**. I was looking forward to it, and my hotel was perfectly placed. Beijing is built on a grid - it should have, by all means, been easy to walk there. It took over two hours, because the city center seems to have decided no one is allowed to cross the street anywhere. I would get somewhere, and then be sent in the complete opposite direction, because I wouldn't be allowed there. The guards' indications ranged from very helpful (a young man took out his phone to translate precise directions for me) to the absolutely unhelpful (guy literally playing League of Legends on his phone and barely pointing in a given direction). 

Eventually I made it, but I learned my lesson: next time, take the metro. Seriously. It would've take a fourth of the time, and probably avoided me enough stress to not ruin the next couple of days.

The Forbidden City is impressive. We spent almost all day there, and we still probably missed on a lot. Plenty of lovely artifacts all around. I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said: it's absolutely great if you enjoy museums. It was, however, very crowded, even on a weekday in low season, so I definitely don't want to see how it would be on a weekend in the summer. Honorable mention to the incredible amount of gift shops, all well-organized and with a very, very wide price range. The merch was lovely, and I wish I had gotten a couple more things that I did, in retrospect, because they seemed very well-made. 

I planned to visit the Summer Palace afterwards, but the morning odyssey had exhausted me, so I pushed it for the next day. 

***Day 8:*** Once again, not a day that went according to plan. I wanted to visit the National Museum, briefly see Tiananmen Square, and then visit the Summer Palace that I hadn't been able to visit the previous day. 

This time, with the metro, getting there was easy, but the **National Museum** was crowded, and with the accumulated stress, I couldn't continue past the first floor. I think this won't be a problem for more neurotypical folks, but I ended up in a corner trying to breathe, and inevitably went back to spend the rest of the day in. 

I did see **Tiananmen Square** on my way out; it was spacious enough that I felt like I could stop for a few minutes. If it were an open square, it could be an amazing center of city life. Unfortunately, it requires a reservation to enter and several checks, and as a simple tourist destination, it's... Empty, without locals hanging around. I have also seen many security cameras in China, but never quite as many as here. Overall, I found it to be mostly a display of government control. Still, many domestic tourists seemed very glad to be there. 

***Day 9:*** Flight back home, with a quick layover in Shanghai. 

I'll leave more considerations in the comments :)",2025,3,14,5,Friday,1809,1809,Long,"detailed china trip report   days in shanghai and beijing im just coming back from a little over a week in china so heres my honest trip report about my experience  as a premise i am autistic and that has definitely influenced things 

tldr it was absolutely lovely and also very overwhelming 

day  i arrived in shanghai relatively late in the evening for the sake of trying something new i took the maglev to the city and then the metro to my hostel my local friend had warned me about the metro having security checks but they were overall very easy to get through barely a few seconds the metro was easy to use and efficient as expected from the biggest metro railway system in the world if you have ever taken the underground before youre hardpressed to get lost in shanghai 

generally i found the city to be more familiar than i expected having been to tokyo and seoul i was expecting something along the same lines but it was closer to being in milan less curated less bright more chaotic a lot dirtier 

day  honestly i only visited shanghai to meet up with a local friend not being in the mood for shopping we just entered the first museum we found the shanghai sports museum it has a mix of art history of sports in shanghai and relics from the olympics incl costumes mascots and torches as someone who doesnt care much about sports i wouldnt go back but its well made and id recommend it to those that might enjoy the theme 

we then visited one of the very few places i actually wanted to see  the propaganda poster art centre its a lovely little collection of propaganda posters as well as some vintage advertisements in a separate room if you have any sort of interest in history or design i heavily recommend it  its gorgeous and it really showcases the depth of propaganda which goes far beyond praising the ccp although certainly not lacking in that aspect regardless of ones personal opinions on the subject matter its a great way to spend half an hour there is also a lovely but unfortunately a bit overpriced gift shop 

under recommendation from my friend we then went to feed the pigeons at peoples park i was expecting it to be a mess but the pigeons are gorgeous tame and very used to feeding the food you can purchase is also healthy for them seeds and they get regularly fed from the people at the park so theyre very happy birds 

day  we went to zhujiajiao it took around two hours with public transport but i honestly didnt mind it at all again the metro was very easy to use 

zhujiajiao is touristic for sure but i felt like that added to the experience its not trying to be a pristine historical town more a great blend of traditional and a little kitchyness just enough to be relaxing and entertaining for families theres plenty of food to try and trinkets to buy and if you stray from the main canal theres even more to see you can also walk right into some of the more residential areas which are far quieter 

right outside of the main canal area youll also find banks fast food chains and convenience shops so if you have a problem with alipay like i did you will be able to find an atm facepalm there we also tried mongolianstyle tea which deserves an honorable mention in my book for being delicious cheap coming with a nice snack platter and mostly being served by a lovely grandma in a comforting little shop   
  
day  i planned to wake up early and go to suzhou to beat the weekend crowds and see the gardens and a couple of museums due to a migraine that wasnt possible so i stayed in instead and in the afternoon i walked around shanghai by myself 

first i went to visit the marriage market in peoples park held every weekend being able to read some of the announcements made the whole experience more fun since i went around trying to find people with specific characteristics as a personal game the folks seemed to be having fun and it was overall a good atmosphere bustling with activity 

the bund was not on my initial list of things to see but i had time to spare as a european i found it to be exactly what i expected  just another fancy city center personally i couldve skipped on it without feeling like i was missing anything at all but i see the appeal for those who might not be familiar with the architecture the iconic skyline was a nice sight though and there were plenty of families having a nice sunday out 

lastly i decided to visit shanghai circus world i love performance and performance arts but its been years since ive last been to a proper circus the show was wellchoreographed and quite lovely although i felt that it could be a bit more polished while most of the performance was impressive a couple of the acrobats missed their jumps more than once   
  
day  i took the train to beijing i wanted to explore the art district the crowds at the station were so overwhelming i had to spend the rest of the afternoon in my hotel room recuperating since my hotel was facing qianmen street i had a nice walk in the evening and enjoyed the lively atmosphere 

be warned that the highspeed train experience is much like an airport many document and security checks and waiting at a gate to board your train instead of just walking onto the platform and boarding like i was used to so definitely show up early 

day  one of the activities i was most looking forward to visiting the great wall my original plan was to go at badaling since it was accessible by public transport and i wasnt sure that mutianyu would be in low season but in the end i had a lastminute change of heart and booked a tour with mubus i am not a tour person but they mostly provided transport tips and food and we were left to explore on our own which is exactly what i wanted i am not sponsored in the slightest but i had a great experience and would absolutely use them again zhili and heili our guides were bright fun and helpful id also spring for the meal again it was delicious 

mutianyu was also a great choice by ish it was almost empty with a couple of people i met on the bus we decided to take the cable car up the east route walk to tower  then walk all the way to  and back to  for the toboggan we wouldve hiked up too but we were advised that we wouldnt have enough time i am not too much in shape and the stairs were a lot steeper than i couldve imagined  some sections i had to climb with my hands as well i made it the lengthandahalf we decided on but my legs have been punishing me for it ever since so consider your shape  if you have to pick a route i found the west route to be both easier and more impressive 

the toboggan down was something i really wanted to do and it was exhilarating for the first m or so then i reached the people below who were proceeding at a snails pace honestly if there is almost no one else id do it bit otherwise i would skip

Second call was similar, but less rude, but couldn't get a supervisor.  ,My friend had a very long call with UA who conferenced in swiss air, and they said that it couldn't be changed, but they put a note in the system so it wouldn't be a problem.  They didn't send us any thing to document.  

I don't know if that action did anything. But they didn't even say anything at check in

BTW, Swiss Air baggage policy regarding skis if you bought tickets through a partner airline is vague.  For us, my friend's UA status provided him with 2 free checked bags.

I am trying to book a ticket for a friend to Thailand from India.

The airlines give option to specify number of adults and number of infants.

 What I am seeing is they are charging the same price for infants as they are for adults, but still not giving any check-in luggage against infant passenger.

I am doubtful even a seat is going to be assigned if we go by this trend.
 
Is this how it happens normally? Because if you are not assigned a seat and check-in baggage then the fair should be less, right?

2. Are there any issues if we check in luggage with all our wine together? (We plan to take home the limit of 1.5L per person and save a bit on check in by putting it all together).

I have been to europe with family, but this would be my first big trip without them. I’m planning on going in December on a group trip for all of these. 

In terms of bucket list, Thailand and Ecuador/Galapagos are pretty high up and tie for priority. I’d love to go to Costa Rica someday, but it’s not as high of priority as the first two destinations. My two main deciding factors are price and time off from work. 

Costa rica is a 10 day trip, is my cheapest option, and leaves me with 21 hours of PTO for the rest of the year. Ecuador and Galapagos is my most expensive option, 11 days long, and leaves me with the most PTO for the rest of the year at 23 hours. Thailand is in the middle for pricing, is 15 days, and gives the biggest hit to my PTO bank, leaving me with only 5 hours left for the rest of the year. 

Costa rica is my safest option if Thailand and Ecuador/Galapagos wont work. Ecuador and galapagos is the most expensive, but leaves me with the most time off left to use. It will require the most intense budgeting, so I’m also wondering if I’ll even need all of that time off because most of my extra money will be going to this trip. Thailand is the riskiest in terms of how much time I’ll have off for the rest of the year, but it’s middle of the road/doable price wise and really high on my bucket list. I think my biggest worry outside of no more PTO left with Thailand is that 15 days is not enough time there, but correct me if I’m wrong.

1. Cincy to CDG (Paris), 1 hour 20 minute layover, CDG to LJU (Slovenia)

2. Cincy to JFK (New York City), 1 hour 5 minute layover, JFK to London Heathrow, 2 hour 45 minute layover, London to Slovenia.

On the surface, the first option seems much more appealing. But I'm nervous about the 1 hour 20 minute layover in CDG. Coming off an international flight, I don't feel like that's enough time. But maybe it is if you are catching a connection on the same airline?

I appreciate anyone's insight on this. If you are recommending the first option, I would appreciate it if you can state whether you have direct experience with this type of situation at the CDG airport.

Thanks!

I'm currently planning a quick solo trip in amalfi for the last leg of my Italy trip in June.

I plan to head to Amalfi from naples on Friday morning and depart to go back to naples the following Monday, so about 3 days total.

I was doing some research on where I should stay as a solo traveller and seems alot say that positano is too touristy with too many steps to get around. 

I also found Amalfi Town as a good option for lodging.  I'm looking for a good coastal town that I can book a nice ocean view hotel that is walking distance to plenty of good food and drink options plus beach to have a nice relaxing time. I also want to be not too far from positano so I can visit it at one point.

What are your comments on choosing Amalfi Town?
Do you have any other alternative suggestions i should research?

Also bonus if you have any activity ideas for the area! I definitely will look into taking a sunset cruise if its not too expensive. 

Many thanks in advanced! 🙏",2,1,travel,"Trip to Amalfi in June Greetings!

We’d love to chill at white sand beaches and chill out, but we’d also like an equal mix of outdoor adventure. Here’s our itinerary right now:

•HCMC/Saigon (4 days)

•Da Nang/Hoi An (5 days)
   -We can’t decide how to split the time. We’d like to get clothes tailored, so we may need more time in Hoi An, though we love coastal beach cities like Da Nang!

•Hanoi (3 days)

•(From Hanoi) Ha Long Bay overnight cruise

•Hanoi (1 rest day)

•Ha Giang Loop Tour (3-4 days, from Hanoi)

•Hanoi (1 rest day, then fly to Bali)

•Ubud (4 days)

•Gili T (5 days)
   -We love the idea of having a white sand beach with the sunset, too. I’ve done research on Bali’s beaches, and they either have beautiful sunsets (with huge crowds and black sand) or no sunset (but white sand and less crowded). Gili T sounded like a great fit.

•Near Depasar 1 night; then fly home the next morning.


We’re trying to keep our honeymoon to around 3 weeks, though this itinerary is more like 25 days, give or take. The weather in Hanoi will be good, but in Saigon it’ll be a hit or miss, and in Da Nang/Hoi An, it’ll be monsoon season. Gili T’s weather is supposedly going to be sunny.

We’d love to know any tips or changes y’all would make, as we’ve never been to either of these countries. I’ve been to Thailand, and fell in love with those beaches, but we’re trying to go places we’ve both never been. Any advice would be great.

Factors in consideration:
1) International, 14 days available including travel. We'll fly out of SFO. Kids have never experienced jet lag. 
2) Not really expensive once we land. We can fork some money over for flights, but Switzerland isn't in the budget. Would prefer to keep things to USD $150-250 per day, including lodging but excluding flights. 
3) Ease of travel. I don't want a car rental, public transportation is fun for the kids. I went to China a long time ago, pre- kids, and I struggled just buying train tickets. I know Google Translate and phones have probably changed this and I must sound like a dinosaur, but I don't want to be stressed out just getting around. 
4) Safe for 3 females. 
5) Mild weather preferred. We can handle heat but don't want to pack winter jackets. 

Likes: we like cities, nature, mountains, beaches, parks, food...well, you name it. My kids aren't real picky and just like to get out and see new things. 

I tried Chatgpt for a list, but would like to hear from real people. On the short list so far is Taipei. Chatgpt also suggested Portugal, which I don't know much about, and Morocco and Mexico - I'm skeptical about both of these feeling safe for three females but feel free to inform me if I'm wrong.

1ja9kcd,2025-03-13 11:15:21,2 weeks itinerary in  laos,Luka_fucks,"Hi everyone,

I’m planning a trip to Laos for two weeks mid-May, and would like some advice on my planned itinerary. Here’s what I have so far:

Day 1: Arrive in Vietiane

Day 2: Explore Vientiane

Day 3: Travel to Thakhek

Day 4-6 (7?): Thakhek Loop

Day 8: Travel to Vang Vieng

Day 9: Explore Vang Vieng

Day 10: Travel to Bokeo

Day 11-12: Explore Bokeo (Gibbon experience?)

Day 13: Travel to Vientiane

Day 14: Fly home



Is this itinerary realistic in terms of travel times?

Should I allocate more time on the Thakhek Loop?

Is Bokeo worth it for the amount of time I’ve allocated?

Are there any other places I should see in or around the areas I’ve mentioned?

1jalh98,2025-03-13 20:12:03,1-28 December in Europe for a family - is this realistic?,Expert_Storm1269,"*EDIT: Understand that the previous itinerary is unrealistic so I have shortened it to....*

*1.  Helsinki to Santa Claus Village, Lapland - 3-5 days including 1 rest day post-traveling from Asia*

*with 3-5 days each for remaining cities*

*2. London*

*3. Paris*

*4. Bernese Oberland*

*5. Florence & Venice; is Milan comparable to Florence for their shopping and food scene?*

*6. Portugal*

My previous post got removed so I am adding more information to my prospective itinerary.

This is a first and once-in-a-lifetime trip to Europe with a family of parents approaching their 60s and siblings entering their 20s. The criteria would be traveling in a logical sequence, essentially a ‘loop’ to/fro Asia, to avoid traversing the same area twice. Mode of transport would be mainly through air travel with the option to do trains or buses. No driving will be preferred.

Any place I should have included or exclude from the journey? Is it a realistic timeline considering we are traveling as a family? Lastly are there benefits for those below 25 years traveling in Europe? I remember using my student card for benefits back then.

1.     Helsinki to Santa Claus Village, Lapland - 3-5 days including 1 rest day post-traveling from Asia

2.     Florence - 2 days. A question to people who have been to both Florence and Milan… is the shopping and dining experience comparable? Which did you prefer?

3.     Venice - 2 days

4.     Geneva - 1.5 day

5.     Bernese Oberland 2-3 days

6.     Colmar 1-2 days

7.     Vienna 2-3 days

I’d love to do gorilla trekking in either Rwanda or Uganda. Yes, I’ve done my research. Rwanda seems a little easier but the permit is $1500 and also accommodations are more expensive. Uganda’s permit is around $600. Everyone recommends hiring porters, which I’d definitely do. My question is, how far do the porters go with you? Groups are limited to 8 people at a time. Does that mean that rangers and porters don’t count since the Gorillas are so used to them? Forget about my bags, can I pay a porter just to hold my hand if I’m going solo? (Serious question) or to take pictures? I’d probably be too overwhelmed between nervousness and excitement, that I don’t know if I could take photos. I also would like to focus on the experience itself.

We will be visiting Scotland with my father in late April. He loves all things astronomy and since Scotland is the farthest North we have been and probably the least populated of any of the places we have been, I was wondering if there are any places we can do some dark sky stargazing with him. 

I did Google to find that there are multiple sites across Scotland where stargazing can be done, but we have a few problems. 

For starters, he's a senior with limited mobility. He's also not big on camping style experiwnce. Secondly, the rest of us don't drive, so getting to a  remote place (which is the ideal place for such stargazing) by ourselves may not be easy.  

So I was wondering if any if you have any recommendations for a somewhat comfortable hotel we could access relatively easily from Glasgow or Edinburgh (where we will be based) to be able to do some night sky watching.

1ja688v,2025-03-13 07:04:01,Online travel agent to book flights found with ITA Matrix?,macshady,"Hello travelers. I found a 4-leg trip via ITA Matrix that is completely reasonable to fly (>4h layovers, direct flights, broken into 2 legs), but the airline's site doesn't allow booking due to rules regarding time interval between 1-way flights entering/departing the same airport. To be clear, I can build my desired itinerary on the carrier's site, select flights/classes for four legs, but get blocked by an error message once I attempt to navigate to the booking/payment part. If it matters, I'm talking about Turkish Airlines.

I could book each leg in a separate transaction, but it comes out over 2x more expensive. Given that ITA Matrix outputs a Fare Construction summary, I imagine a travel agent may be able to jam the flights into the carrier's system since the agent may have access to booking tools other than the regular commercial booking website for the carrier.

Has anyone heard of an agent that offers this sort of service with no frills? Like, I give agent the Fare Construction info, expected cost, and price tolerance band (+10% acceptable or sth), and the agent takes this input and books?

I've already tried 10+ OTAs, direct with the carrier, calling the carrier (how I learned about the policy), other reddit posts. I've gotten within +25% price difference, but I'd rather not go with 3rd party online provider if feasible.",11,2,travel,"Online travel agent to book flights found with ITA Matrix? Hello travelers.

I live in Germany and am planning on going the first or last week of May for 3-5 days. Id like a trail where i can park and hike a loop back to the same place. Where i can camp and have fires for free or very little. 

Im quite used to being by the Rockies where you can find hot springs and great hiking route all the time. And can camp for free on crown land. 

I loved backpacking the big elbow loop in the Rockies. the loop itself is quite easy and you can set up camp and summit the mountains around if you want as-well. 

Also the secret jem of the Mist mountain trail 
Where you have a hot springs on the side of the mountain. A dream but, i live in Germany now so…

Id like something a bit closer to me  then these but I’m looking at stuff like:

The Arizona hot springs trails 

Iceland's Laugavegur Trail
 
Spain’s el Camino

I would love any suggestions that are
- in the Alps 
- with driving distance of Germany.

The metropolitan area is huge and sprawling, full of skyscrapers intertwined with numerous hills and surrounded by beautiful mountains.   

The municipality of San Pedro Garza Garcia is extremely affluent and full of excellent restaurants, beautiful parks and luxury shops. Monterey itself is also a sight to see, especially the Macroplaza and Barrio Antigua areas. 

I only had a few days but I loved it. With the popularity of Mexico City, and the ambudence of flights to MTY, I’m shocked there’s almost zero US tourists around. However, you see the economic and cultural connections between the US and Mexico at every turn. You will enjoy it more if you speak basic Spanish but the area was fairly easily to navigate as a tourist.  

I only had 2 and a half days but I will definitely be back.

* I was supposed to take a New York -> Geneva -> Zürich -> Nice flight back in December. The New York -> Geneva leg was cancelled on the same day, and I had to exchange my flight on the Swiss app. I ended up doing New York -> Lisbon -> Nice with a long layover and arriving in Nice much later.

* Given the distance between New York and Geneva, according to regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, I was entitled to a €600 compensation + food/drink/etc. expenses.

* There is a form you can fill on the Swiss website to ask for the compensation. Swiss e-mailed me saying they wouldn't compensate me, because the flight cancellation wasn't their fault, it was due to air traffic control restrictions (""contrôle de restriction du trafic aéroportuaire""). They agreed to refund my ~€30 expenses (even though I hadn't kept the receipts, I guess they probably wanted me to leave them alone).

* I replied to their e-mail, reminding them about my rights, and telling them that they cannot just state that there were air traffic control restrictions, they have to provide the evidence that they did all they could to not cancel the flight.

* They replied with some generic e-mail that stated once again that I wouldn't get compensation because the flight was canceled due to air traffic control restrictions and it wasn't their fault.

At that point I wasn't sure what to do. Some people online said that air traffic control restrictions was actually a valid reason do deny compensation. Some people said that using AirHelp (or similar companies) worked for them, but they keep 35% of the compensation, which would be €210 euro on a €600 compensation, so quite significant.

Since the final destination was in France, I tried going through the French DGAC at first, but they wouldn't let me because the canceled leg's destination was in Switzerland. So I decided to go through the Swiss FOCA. I used this form:

Hello all,

As the title says, I want to visit these three countries (Aug-Sept). Have any gay men here traveled to these places recently and had any issues? 

I will be in Astana solo for 2 days, take either the talgo or soviet style train to almaty where I will link up with a tour group where we will go through southern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Afterwards, (what I am most concerned about) is going to Samarkand solo. 

If I just stay in the closet, don’t mention Im gay, and be respectful, will I be ok (especially in Uzbekistan) I know its illegal to be gay there and in Kyrgyzstan, but will I be fine despite that by just keeping it a secret and not going on gay dating apps, and not having explicit content on my phone?

1j8q5g0,2025-03-11 12:59:38,Don’t fall for Etihad’s free stopover program. Here’s how they left me on my own.,CC-Master3,"Hello everyone,

I will share with you my bad experience with Etihad’s free stopover program, which turned out to be nothing but a false advertisement.

I was looking to book tickets from Istanbul to Thailand when I saw that Etihad offers free stopover for up to 4 days in Abu Dhabi and I said to myself ‘free stay in Abu Dhabi, why not?’ and booked the flights. Shortly after checkout I was given the option to choose a hotel, which I did. 1 week before my flight from Thailand to Abu Dhabi I decided to open Etihad’s app and check the booking status. It was still saying “Hotel booking in progress. Confirmation details will be emailed shortly.”, so I decided to contact their customer support on Instagram. I provided all my booking details, they checked and assured me that there is nothing to worry about and I should receive an email soon. 2 days before the flight and still no mail, so I decided to contact them again. They sent me a list of hotels and told me to choose 3, which I did. To my surprise, a day later I receive an email asking me to choose a hotel - again. They also mention that this stopover will cost $250 per person or $500 for the room for 4 nights. Not only this was never mentioned when I was booking, but they ask for $500 when in fact only 2 of the hotels were worth more than that on Booking. I replied back with screenshots of their ‘free’ stopover deal and guess what - I received no answer. After my second mail, they replied with the following:

“This is not correct, so it not a possible to offer 4 nights for free. 
 
We’re sorry to let you know that all our participating stopover hotels in Abu Dhabi are fully booked.”

No apologies, nothing. They left me stay 4 days in Abu Dhabi on my own, without even offering me to change my flight for an earlier. 

I can’t believe how such a big airline is allowed to do such things. I am sharing this with you, and I will post it in a few more subreddits because they don’t seem to care about their customers. Hope this post will prevent someone from falling into the same trap as me.

I am planning on going to Japan for the second time in October this year.
The first time I was in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Hiroshima.
So this time I am thinking about flying to Tokyo again, spending some time there. But to be honest I need some inspiration on what to visit and see for other cities.
Id like some bigger cities with the possibility of reaching nature and having beautiful sights. Maybe a bit of nightlife? Did any of you solo travellers go party alone? I thought about booking a hostel but really just want my peace and quiet when I get back from exploring all day, so I dont think a hostel is for me.

1ja920x,2025-03-13 10:42:06,Flight rescheduling,gunsofgilead,"Quick query. Had an international flight booked with Thai airways. I've had to leave two days early because of a death in the family.

I've asked if I can use the return flight, but advised I can't because it's a promo flight and if I don't board one way can't use the return flight.

Is this the norm or are Thai airways being fuckwits? I don't understand how me not taking the first flight fucks me over for the return. They get an extra fuckin seat. I don't travel that often, so I'm not sure what to make of this.

Thank you.



  
edit: Thank you for taking the time to comment. I still don't see how it's fair to cancel a whole ticket when I've asked them almost three days in advance to forfeit the outbound flight but retain the return trip. I was just hoping for a legitimate reason to not let me use the return flight.

I’ll be spending a few days on the Samaná Peninsula during my upcoming trip to the Dominican Republic. Staying in Las Galeras and Las Terrenas, and I’d love to fit in a boat tour to Los Haitises National Park from Samaná town.

I’ve checked Viator and similar booking sites, but most of the available options seem to be full-day tours. However, I’ve read that half-day tours (around 3–4 hours) are available if you book directly in town. Has anyone had experience finding a half-day tour by just showing up at the Samaná port?

If so:

* What time do these tours usually leave?
* Any recommended local operators?
* What’s a reasonable price to expect? ($30–$40?)
* Is it better to book in advance, or can I just show up and find a spot?

Peru/Bolivia/Chile Itinerary Feedback :)

Hi :)

My girlfriend and I are planning a 5 week trip to Peru, the first two will be as part of a larger group and are fixed, as we've got the opportunity to do it as part of a concert trip for quite cheap.


Day 1-14 Fixed Schedule (Lima, Trujillo, Arequipa, Cusco including Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu)

Day 15-16 Relaxing in Cusco

Day 17 Lake Humantay trip

Day 18 Rainbow Mountain trip

Day 19 Relaxing in Cusco

Day 20-26 7 days in Manu National park in the Amazon (also considering Puerto Maldonado and going to Tambopata instead - any tips here?)

Day 27 Cusco/ Night trip to Puno or Copacabana (undecided which one)

Day 28 Lake Titicaca/Trip to La Paz

Day 29 La Paz/in the evening start trip to San Pedro de Atacama over Uyuni

Day 30-32 Uyuni salt flats to San Pedro

Day 33+34 San Pedro/Moon Valley/Stargazing

Day 35 San Pedro to Santiago (Flight)

Day 36 Flight back from Santiago

Considering whether an additional day at Lake Titicaca or in La Paz could make sense.

Would appreciate any feedback from people who have done similar journeys or parts of it :)

1j9o2gv,2025-03-12 16:27:44,Travel Insurance Advice - Single Trip,bluerog,"I have 17-days in Europe planned in April with Wife. (We're American). Total transportation cost is about $2,700 in intercontinental and inner-Europe flights. Hotel stay value is about $2,500. I'm using mostly hotel points for the $2,500 in hotel value. Beyond 2 visas (UK & Turkey $300), I don't have other expenses that I'd want covered. Baggage is 2 backpacks and $600 worth of stuff in them. 

Travel insurance sites are quoting me $200 to $250ish. Allianz is closer to $390. Trawick and General are the cheap ones. All travel insurance places seem to make one hop through hoops for reimbursement (which I'm sure is understandable). I've used Allianz before... but it's 80% more expensive.

Long story short, I selected flights and sent him very clear screenshots of the dates and times I would be booking, he says “that’s perfect”. 

But of course, he’s an idiot and I’m basically going to be stranded in San Antonio for two days with no family because they’re leaving on the 13th, and my return flight is the night of the 15th. Anyone got any experience kinda winging it and hanging around the area, or have any basic info about if there’s public transit around the area to go and explore? I jumped through soooo many hoops to be able to attend and couldn’t even afford to pay for my ticket all in one go, I had to do installments.. I say that to say I tried to change my flight and I just cannot afford that. I’m trying not to be bummed out and scared, I’m very wary of being stuck in an airport especially in a red state, so I’m looking to make the most of my extra time there. Should I ask in another sub?

I'm finding it hard to get a handle on the different islands and countries without going for an all inclusive resort (something we aren't really interested in). 

What we're looking for:

\- decent flight connection from JFK/Newark

\- good food, specifically local cuisine!

\- the classic white beach/blue water combo (I'd love to see some fish while snorkeling!)

\- non-beachy activity options-- nature hikes, cultural locations, etc. Would prefer a place with interesting local milieu/culture

\- not horrifically sweltering hot in late June, if possible

\- easy on a budget, someplace that won't break the bank!

1j8s1fo,2025-03-11 14:28:43,Longtime Southwest Flyer Ready to Switch - Which of the Big 3 Do You Prefer More?,InfinityLocs,"I’ve been a loyal Southwest Airlines customer for years, but with the recent changes and lack of incentives, I’ve decided to make the switch once I use up my remaining Rapid Rewards points. Since I prefer to stick with one airline for all my travel, I want to transition as soon as possible so I can start earning status and points elsewhere.

I know American, Delta, and United all have their pros and cons, and I’d love some insight from frequent flyers. I’ve lived in several places, and my home airport has all three, so I expect that wherever I move in the future, they’ll still be viable options.

My main priorities when choosing a new airline:

* Customer Service – How do they handle delays, cancellations, and general customer experience?

* Convenience – Availability of flights, on-time performance, and ease of booking.
* Loyalty Perks – How rewarding is their frequent flyer program as you move up in tiers?

I’m currently leaning toward American Airlines, but I’d love to hear if there’s something particularly great (or frustrating) about them compared to Delta or United. If you’ve made a similar switch, what’s your experience been like?

Would appreciate any insights—thanks!",86,42,travel,"Longtime Southwest Flyer Ready to Switch - Which of the Big 3 Do You Prefer More? I’ve been a loyal Southwest Airlines customer for years, but with the recent changes and lack of incentives, I’ve decided to make the switch once I use up my remaining Rapid Rewards points. Since I prefer to stick with one airline for all my travel, I want to transition as soon as possible so I can start earning status and points elsewhere.

I know American, Delta, and United all have their pros and cons, and I’d love some insight from frequent flyers. I’ve lived in several places, and my home airport has all three, so I expect that wherever I move in the future, they’ll still be viable options.

My main priorities when choosing a new airline:

* Customer Service – How do they handle delays, cancellations, and general customer experience?

1j9gfu5,2025-03-12 09:52:07,Europe Travel Recommendations for August,Sudden-Part-648," Hello!

My fiancé and I are planning to take a 2-week vacation in August this summer to Europe. She is a medical doctor, and will be finishing her residency this July. So this is a graduation trip for her. I have tried asking her where she wants to go to celebrate, but she cannot decide on anything.  We need help with some recommendations on where to visit. Some specifics:

-We have both been to various different parts of Europe together and separately and love to travel. Examples: Germany, Italy, Ireland, England, Spain, Switzerland. 

-We are wanting to avoid the extreme August heat and crowds that are common in places like Italy, etc. 

-Our dates of travel will be from 8/2 - 8/14 or 8/15. 

Traveling from Indiana, USA. For European travel, we generally fly from the IND airport and connect through one of the major hubs on the east coast (I.e. Atlanta, Boston, New York). 

-We enjoy doing a little bit of everything: history (museums, old churches, etc.), food scene, nature & hiking, shopping, nice hotels.

-With our 2-week travel time, looking to visit a few different cities across one or two countries. 

-Prefer train travel between locations after getting to Europe. Don’t want to get on another plane after making it abroad. 

Would appreciate any recommendations! ",7,0,travel,"Europe Travel Recommendations for August  Hello!

My biggest concern is how to go about ""hiding"" the ring in a way she won't see it if she opens my bag while keeping in mind the possibility that TSA could flag my bag, and potentially open everything up in front of her, allowing her to see it before the moment I have planned for us. What would you all recommend I do? I am bringing 1 carry on suitcase (which will have shoes, electronics, toiletries, chargers, snacks such as Pringles, pretzels, etc) and 1 personal item (a 50 Liter military looking bag with a few pockets. I'll include a picture of a similar bag in this post).

My original plan was to hide the tiny 2 inch by 1.5 inch by 0.5 inch ring box inside of one of my hiking shoes which will be in my carry on however given that my carry on will have food, toiletries and other stuff that might make the bag get flagged would it be safer to put it in my personal item? Also if you're a TSA agent or have been on in the past I would love to hear if you ever saw an engagement ring on the scanner and how you went about it (I'm also curious if you think the scanner will give a clear image of the ring even if its inside the ring box. One of my friends told me to separate them but I was thinking if the little box goes off on the scanner because of the magnet inside of it, wouldn't it be better if there was a ring inside for context of what the random box is for?).

Obviously I dont think a TSA agent would go out of there way to ruin the surprise but I also dont know what the protocol is. Thank you to anyone who can provide insight into helping me with my challenge here. 

Note: I was going to post this in the official TSA reddit but don't have the karma for it (they have a minimum) so I figured id post it here.

",2025,3,12,19,Wednesday,394,394,Long,"how to go about hiding engagement ring in carry on  personal item hi everyone i am writing this post because i am planning to go on a trip in the next  days where i will be proposing to my girlfriend my biggest concern is how to go about hiding the ring in a way she wont see it if she opens my bag while keeping in mind the possibility that tsa could flag my bag and potentially open everything up in front of her allowing her to see it before the moment i have planned for us what would you all recommend i do i am bringing  carry on suitcase which will have shoes electronics toiletries chargers snacks such as pringles pretzels etc and  personal item a  liter military looking bag with a few pockets ill include a picture of a similar bag in this post

my original plan was to hide the tiny  inch by  inch by  inch ring box inside of one of my hiking shoes which will be in my carry on however given that my carry on will have food toiletries and other stuff that might make the bag get flagged would it be safer to put it in my personal item also if youre a tsa agent or have been on in the past i would love to hear if you ever saw an engagement ring on the scanner and how you went about it im also curious if you think the scanner will give a clear image of the ring even if its inside the ring box one of my friends told me to separate them but i was thinking if the little box goes off on the scanner because of the magnet inside of it wouldnt it be better if there was a ring inside for context of what the random box is for

obviously i dont think a tsa agent would go out of there way to ruin the surprise but i also dont know what the protocol is thank you to anyone who can provide insight into helping me with my challenge here 

note i was going to post this in the official tsa reddit but dont have the karma for it they have a minimum so i figured id post it here

1j9a4j9,2025-03-12 03:37:51,Travel Report - San Andrés Island Colombia,venzenden,"San Andres, the Colombian Island I never knew I wanted to visit. 

When I chose to travel to Colombia I never thought that I would find myself on a Caribbean Island off the Coast of Nicaragua. That said, the week that I spent there was a perfect break. 

**Getting there**

 It is easy to catch a flight from several mainland cities including Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and Cartagena. I flew with LATAM and found better deals by accessing the their Latin America website. My Spanish is rudimentary, but browser translation made it a breeze. 

**Things to know before you go**

\- You need proof of onward travel and may be asked to show proof of reservation on arrival. 

\- There is an entrance tax which must be paid at the airport of origin. You will need to show proof of payment before boarding, and it is best to ask at the check in/ticket desk ahead of time. I forgot about this and was in danger of missing my flight as i rushed to sort it out. 

\- English is often spoken, but not always. I found that people generally appreciate it if you try to speak a little Spanish. 

**Precautions**

 \- Do not drink the tap water. 

\- There may be mosquitoes at night and its worth researching mosquito born illness. I did not need vaccination but the Columbian government website does warn about mosquito born illness in their Island territories. 



The week I spent there was strictly about R&R. I chose to stay in a small town on the South East side called San Luis. It was very close to a great beach, and my airbnb was clean, comfortable, and close to stores so I could get groceries and cook. I was pleased that I avoided the bustle of the main city. 

I am not the nightlife type, but overall I felt very safe during my stay. The vibe was similar to other Caribbean Islands that I have visited in the past. 

No Uber, but taxies are safe IMO. I took one from the airport for $40000 COP but I may have been overcharged. The rest of the time on the Island I used the public bus which had a flat rate of 5000 COP and will get you to most parts of the Island including a stop right outside the airport. They run from about 7am to about 8pm :)

 

**Conclusion** 

If you are looking for a sunny spot with great beaches and chilled out vibes I would recommend. My travel buddy spent several days getting her SCUBA certification through a PADI certified dive shop (Sea Pride). She had great things to say about the diving. 

Last suggestion: grilled red snapper with coconut rice and plantain. Pineapple or Mango Juice if your a teatotaller like me. 

Cheers.

1j91lvz,2025-03-11 21:04:20,8 Days in Portugal -> Start and End In Lisbon,Hilbee,"Hello Everyone. I was fortunate enough to have an unexpected visit (only the afternoon) to Porto a few months ago and absolutely loved the city and people. I was on a business trip at the time, but vowed to bring my family. (Wife and 2 college age daughters).

Fortunately, my airline tickets are now booked for Lisbon (Land & Depart) for early June (arriving on a Tuesday). I will start and end in Lisbon, but will have 8 days between flights to explore Portugal. My initial plan is to land and drive a rental car towards Porto where we will spend a few days and then make are way down towards the Faro area. I plan to return to Lisbon the morning prior to my flight.

Since we are landing from a long flight, I would like to know if there is a suggested overnight village enroute to Porto. Maybe a fun walk in town or coastal area for the family? The next morning, I would continue to Porto for at least 1 night, maybe 2.

After Porto, plan would be head towards the Faro area (or looking on suggestion on where you would stay). My girls are blown away over the beauty of the coastal area (from pictures only) and want to experience it first hand. Any suggestions on sights or lodging would be much appreciated. I'm open to airbnb apartment or nicer hotel that may fit a family of 4.

We will end in Lisbon the night prior to my flight home. In total we have 8 full days in Portugal to explore this amazing country.

\*\*\* I know crowds will likely be high, but would appreciate if any suggestions of beautiful areas that may be less busy. Lastly, the cities above are my thoughts, but open to other locations since we will have a car for the week.

My flight will be departing from Terminal 1, and I'll be checking in online beforehand, and without hold luggage, just a carry-on.

Am I right in thinking that after making my way through security, I then have to go through passport control before getting to my gate? And if so, can I just go straight to passport control from security, or do I have to wait for my gate to be announced first? I'd much rather get there early and get the queueing out of the way rather than having to risk waiting for a gate announcement then queueing for passport control 30 minutes before my flight.

So far this is what we are thinking:

April 6 Sunday: Istanbul, arrive at 1pm

April 7 Monday: Istanbul

April 8 Tuesday : Istanbul

April 9 Wednesday: Istanbul, fly to NAV (Cappadocia) at night 8pm, direct flight

April 10 Thursday: Cappadocia.. Try to air balloon this day

April 11 Friday: Cappadocia. Back up air balloon if 1st day fails because of weather

April 12 Saturday: Fly to ADB airport from ASR, direct flight. Rent a car at ADB. Go to Ephesus, then Pamukkale, before ending the night in Fethiye. BUSY DAY!

April 13 Sunday: Fethiye

April 14 Monday: Fethiye, then drive to head towards Antalya

April 15 Tuesday: Antalya

April 16 Wednesday: Antalya, return car, fly out at night



Does this itinerary make sense? We want to see a lot, but also don't want to necessarily burn ourselves out. Is there something we should consider or replace?

I keep reading that we can spend 7 days in Istanbul itself, so I don't know if I should cut something, and what to cut.

Our interests are food, amazing sights, relaxing (spas/bathhouses/hot springs), adventures (hiking), and we also do not drink alcohol!

Thanks!

April 11 Friday: Cappadocia. Back up air balloon if 1st day fails because of weather

April 12 Saturday: Fly to ADB airport from ASR, direct flight. Rent a car at ADB. Go to Ephesus, then Pamukkale, before ending the night in Fethiye. BUSY DAY!

April 13 Sunday: Fethiye

April 14 Monday: Fethiye, then drive to head towards Antalya

April 15 Tuesday: Antalya

April 16 Wednesday: Antalya, return car, fly out at night



Does this itinerary make sense? We want to see a lot, but also don't want to necessarily burn ourselves out. Is there something we should consider or replace?

I keep reading that we can spend 7 days in Istanbul itself, so I don't know if I should cut something, and what to cut.

Our interests are food, amazing sights, relaxing (spas/bathhouses/hot springs), adventures (hiking), and we also do not drink alcohol!

Thanks!

Heading to London next year with my boyfriend for our 10-year anniversary (!) and looking for ideas for where to stay, activities and experiences, shops, day trips, restaurants, and parks, for a relaxed, cozy, fun trip. 

**Important context:** We have been to London once before and did all of the major tourist attractions, which we mostly found crowded and overwhelming. Glad we saw them, but looking to take things slower and travel more off the beaten path this time since we are homebodies and new to traveling.

**Timeline:** March, April, September, or October for \~6 nights. We don't mind the cold or rain of shoulder seasons :)

**Budget:** Flexible and willing to splurge a little since it is a special trip and we don't travel often. Flights will cost us around \~$1,500 total, and hope to keep hotel at $1,500 or less.

**Things we like:** Birding, F1, board games, crafting + sewing, stationary, lego, books, tennis, coins, easy hikes + nature, cafes, markets. Also big fan of Paddington Bear lol. 

**Dislike:** We are not really into drinking, night life, and food that is experimental / over the top / super pricey. Museums can be cool, but I don't enjoy to spend more than an hour or so at one. 

**Current ideas:** The Barbican, Neal’s Yard, day trip to Brighton, afternoon tea somewhere, Dishoom.

For example, in some places they say that just having a UK resident permit and a foreign national passport is not enough to enter Serbia and on their portal they are saying that even if one does not have a sticker in their passport they can show the resident permit and they will be good to go. (please see below, screenshot from their Welcome to Serbia portal). Maybe I am understanding them incorrectly, but need to ensure that the above is allowed as it would be scary for someone to reach Serbia but then be turned back and so any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

Currently planning a 3 week trip to Bolivia and Peru in April/May. Most is set but I’m not sure about the following:

21.4. Taking a 15.30 bus from La Paz to Puno 

22.4. Lake Titicaca/Uros Tour 

23.4. Taking the 6am bus to Chivay (Colca Canyon) 

24.4. Taking an afternoon bus to Arequipa 

25.4. Exploring Arequipa and evening flight to Cusco 

26.4. Sacred valley trip 

27.4. Starting the Salkantay trek

I am planning to fly with China Eastern from Frankfurt to Tokyo in November 2025, and I would like to book the flight now. However, since I am getting married in the summer, my last name will change. The problem is that China Eastern requires all information to be provided at the time of booking, and I read that it's especially crucial to provide the correct name.

My idea is as follows:

I would enter my new last name in the booking along with my current passport number. When I obtain my new passport, I would then try to have the number changed somehow. Do you think this could be a problem, or should it be possible? Unfortunately, I can't find any specific information on this matter. If I wait until July to book the flights, it would be too late and probably sold out.

Has anyone had similar experiences and can perhaps share some insights? I would book directly through the China Eastern website.",9,1,travel,"China Eastern Name change after Marriage Hello everyone,

I'm traveling to Europe this June/July as a solo female traveler. I have 14 nights/ 15 days. The itinerary is as follows so far (""N""= ""night""):

N1: Fly into Copenhagen/ Copenhagen

N2: Copenhagen

N3: Copenhagen

N4:

N5:

N6:

N7:

N8:

N9: Venice

N10: Venice

N11: Dolomites

N12: Dolomites

N13: Dolomites

N14: Milan (return car to Venice, travel to Milan)

As you can see, I have 5 days free. My original plan was Sweden and some Swedish islands but then I read about Portugal and thought it could be enough time to go to Lagos and Lisbon. I was weary about the heat but I read it's not bad there. I am someone who only likes to spend 1-2 days somewhere and hit it really hard. But my other thought is do I stick with something more like Sweden and then travel down to Austria for 1-2 days (I could even knit the first night in Venice). I just couldn't figure out if Sweden was well worth it tbh. I'm going to Venice because I'm renting my car from there. I love nature but figured I'm getting a ton of that in the Dolomites so I'm not totally set on that. Keep in mind I'm a female solo traveler but would love to hear thoughts and suggestions! Thanks in advance

1j8o9zi,2025-03-11 11:11:48,Flying from UK to Japan looking for medication advice for airlines.,Mightynubnub,"Hi everyone,

I'm struggling to find specific information for my situation and was hoping someone here might be able to help. I’ve already reached out to Osaka KIX Airport and German customs for guidance, but I’d appreciate any advice from those with experience.

We’re flying from the UK to Japan in April for a 24-day stay. I use Mounjaro (tirzepatide) via quick pen and will need to bring a three-week supply along with needles. We’ll also be carrying basic medications like paracetamol, ibuprofen, and allergy meds.

From my research, I understand that I need to complete an import form for Japan for the Mounjaro. However, I’m concerned about the logistics due to our flight itinerary:

    Flight Route:
        British Airways: UK → Frankfurt, Germany (we need to go through check-in and security again)
        Cathay Pacific: Frankfurt → Hong Kong → Osaka, Japan

Because we’ll be passing through Germany and Hong Kong, I’m unsure if I need to complete any additional forms or declarations for either country regarding my medication.

Additionally, I need clarification on the best way to carry medications on the flight:

I know they should be in carry-on luggage, but do they need to be in original packaging?

The Mounjaro pen will be opened because I’ll be taking my first dose before the flight—will this be an issue?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Let me know if I need to clarify anything further.

Thanks in advance",7,0,travel,"Flying from UK to Japan looking for medication advice for airlines. Hi everyone,

Next day, the vehicle stopped working in the middle of my chores. And now the horror starts...

1. The English speaking customer service closes at 1600 CET
2. There is no case reference given when you call
3. There is no record of any promises made, details provided
4. No local phone number to call, so every time you have to go through the European automated call center

After an hour on phones, the best that Sixt came up with was to offer me another vehicle that was 35 minutes drive away.

Picked that one up, came back to the original one. The tow truck showed up but didn't wait for 10 minutes while I unloaded the broken vehicle.

So I had to leave the broken vehicle by the roadside and come back the next morning. The tow truck insisted that I travel with them to the repair shop, which took another hour. The Sixt recommended repair shop was not equipped to repair the vehicle, so the tow truck spent another 30 minutes to find out what next. Luckily, the driver told me that I can leave.

Now it is 11th March 2025, a full THREE months later... Got an email from Sixt stating that there is new damage to the broken vehicle and they want me to explain it.

Luckily, I had purchased full insurance. But this is so incompetent and unprofessional of Sixt!!

Posting here rather than in r/travelwithkids people without kids will still be able to give much appreciated advice.

We (hubs and I and currently 2 month old baby) need to get out of our small middle-of-nowhere town (Australia) for a much needed but short notice break. We have flight credit with Qantas to use also so can afford a few flights.
We have about 3 weeks but will probably spend a week-ish with my parents in a major Australian East Coast city. 

So that leaves two weeks in April! 
Baby will be 3 months old. Hubs and I are pretty well traveled but this is our first time with a baby - scary! We do really enjoy big cities for short periods but usually prefer smaller towns and nature overall. 

The dream is:
- Only staying in 2-3 locations over the two weeks
- Cute small towns with great cafes and fun shops that are walkable
- Accommodation in a beautiful spot so that if baby isn’t up for driving around we can still be somewhere fun
- Walks/easy hikes and beautiful scenery 
- Short drives overall, ideally less than 2 hours total most days while exploring surroundings, and max 4 hours when moving location 

Options are:
1. Tasmania. Haven’t seen any of it!
2. Some part of Western Australia: maybe Perth or south of Perth. If this option maybe public transport only so we don’t have to hire a car… We haven’t done any of WA and apparently it’s stunning
3. North Island New Zealand (hubs and I have already done the South Island. Baby has a passport already). If this option would really want to see Hobbiton and maybe the glowworm caves and the southern lights if they cooperate. I’m leaning toward this option!

Would love your thoughts between these locations and specific recommendations for where to stay, things to see, walks, and any other general tips!",2,1,travel,"Help us choose: Western Aus, Tasmania, or New Zealand with a 3 month old? First time poster - sorry if I mess anything up!

1j8cmox,2025-03-10 23:21:01,Tips for first time traveling with Pegasus,chickenlegs_8,"Hello, I hope you all are doing great! 

I will be flying with Pegasus from Istanbul to Amsterdam for the first time in a couple of months.

I have been reading so many bad reviews and I’m getting slightly anxious. It’s also my first time flying for that long 3hrs+ and I’m not much of a fan of long flights tbh… 

Is it worth it to pay for the XL seats? I’d like to be comfortable during my flight but I just can’t find alot of pictures of the seats and the ones I found, the XL seats look narrow. 

I’d appreciate any other tips to make my trip smoother.

I am from a cold part of Canada so I am used to the cold and snow, but the weather forecast has me nervous. It looks like it will be colder and more snow and ice covered than I thought. Could I ask you to comment what driving will likely look like for the week starting on the 15th? Will driving be hazardous or do you expect that it will be on dry pavement? We have to have dedicated winter tires where I am from, and I am nervous about driving the young kids around without them if it will be in winter conditions. 
Also, is there currently snow on the ground? Such as at local parks for kids? 
I am also wondering about the attractions and hiking trails - will everything be open and are microspikes necessary? My partner is thinking about taking the financial hit and renting
in Phoenix instead. I have really wanted to visit Flagstaff and surrounding areas, but must admit that the weather forecast has cooled me down somewhat, especially with young kids. 
Any input would be much appreciated!

I’m planning a 4-day trip to southern Tunisia and will be speaking with a travel agent tomorrow. I’d love to hear your thoughts on my itinerary—especially from those who’ve been to the region! Also, I want to make sure I ask the right questions before booking.

# Here’s the itinerary the travel agent sent me:

# Day 1: Tunis – Tozeur

* Early morning departure from Tunis to Tozeur
* Check-in at Ras El Ain hotel
* Horse-drawn carriage tour of Tozeur’s oasis
* Sunset quad biking in the sand dunes
* Dinner & free evening

# Day 2: Tozeur – Natural Wonders & Exploration

* 4x4 tour to mountain oases (Chebika, Tamerza, Midès)
* Visit waterfalls & Star Wars filming site (Ong Jmal)
* Explore Nefta’s Corbeille
* Evening visit to Chak Wak Park

# Day 3: Tozeur – Douz (Sahara Experience)

* Stop at Chott El Jerid (salt lake) for tea & photos
* Arrive in Douz for lunch
* Camel ride at sunset, overnight at a Sahara camp

# Day 4: Douz – Matmata – Tunis

* Visit Matmata’s troglodyte houses & have lunch
* Drive back to Tunis

The travel agent quoted **500€ per person** for a group of six. Does that seem reasonable for this itinerary?

For those who’ve done a similar trip, would you recommend any changes? Any activities or places worth adding/removing?

Also, are there any specific questions I should ask the travel agent before finalizing the booking? (Hidden costs, transport, food options, etc.)

1j86q0r,2025-03-10 19:12:12,Peru Itinerary Advice & Must-Sees,almostcometa,"Hi everyone! My husband (M29) and I (F27) are traveling to Peru soon, and I’d love some advice on our itinerary. He is more experienced with hiking, while I have never hiked before. We love nature, don’t care about partying, and want to see as much as possible while still having some time to relax.

Here’s our itinerary:

📍 **Lima (April 17-19)** – Arrival + free day  
📍 **Cusco (April 19-21)** – Flight in, exploring, and Sacred Valley tour (overnight in Ollantaytambo)  
📍 **Machu Picchu (April 22-23)** – 2-day Inca Trail  
📍 **Cusco (April 24-25)** – Rest + Rainbow Mountain (April 25)  
📍 **Arequipa (April 26-29)** – Flight in, exploring, Colca Canyon trek  
📍 **Puerto Maldonado or Tarapoto (April 30-May 2)** – Still deciding between the two!  
📍 **Lima (May 2-4)** – Flight back, explore, then fly home

A few questions:

* **Rainbow Mountain:** Is this too much so soon after Machu Picchu? Will altitude be an issue?
* **Colca Canyon:** I’ve read mixed things—how strenuous is it, and is it worth it?
* **Jungle Choice:** We’re debating between **Puerto Maldonado and Tarapoto**. Any recommendations on which one is better for nature/wildlife experiences?
* **Extra Day:** We were thinking of adding an extra day in the jungle instead of flying out on May 2. Is it worth it, or should we use this day elsewhere in the trip?
* **Are we missing anything?** Is there something we absolutely should see that’s not on our itinerary?
* **Hotels & Restaurants:** Any must-stay places or great food spots in any of these locations?
* **Clothing Advice:** What essential clothes should we bring

Any advice or recommendations would be amazing! Thanks so much 😊",4,1,travel,"Peru Itinerary Advice & Must-Sees Hi everyone!

1j86ek5,2025-03-10 18:59:28,Please help me figure out what makes sense for a Spain/Portugal trip with kids in the summer. Struggling to make it work and narrowing down an itinerary.,l4fashion,"So my wife and I have time to travel late June to early July for about just shy of 3 weeks. We have a 7 and 4 year old and want to go to Spain.

There are a few cities I REALLY want to visit, but it's all over the place and I'm not sure it's doable.

My top wish-list cities to visit:

* Valencia
* Porto
* Granada
* San Sebastian
* Cordoba

Secondary wish-list cities to visit:

* Madrid
* Santiago de Compostela
* Mallorca
* Cadiz
* Barcelona
* Sevilla
* Lisboa

I'm open to other ideas.

We want to just get to know the culture better, see awesome things and tours, do fun things for the kids, go to the beach, and eat/drink. 

Will a lot of these cities be too hot to visit in June/July? Are they too all over the place and we'd just end up jumping around too much? Should I focus on just one region? Which one? 

I want to balance doing as much as possible and seeing as many different cities, while also having down time and not overwhelming the kids and not dying of heat stroke. Has anyone else done this with young kids?

Thanks!

1j8edus,2025-03-11 00:43:32,Travel destinations for family with newborn,saucenjuice,"Hello!
I have about a month of family leave that will expire on my son’s first birthday. My wife is currently a full time stay at home mom. We want to use the family leave to travel somewhere interesting (Me, wife, and baby).
1. Our budget is $15k, preferably closer to $10-12k.
2. Trip would be somewhere between mid august and mid october for ~4 weeks.
3. We’re looking to “stay put”. We may consider splitting our month between 2 close destinations, but leaning toward one home base for whole month and day trips sprinkled throughout.
4. If there’s any place that has easy-to-use nannie’s or childcare for travelers, that would be huge.
5. Europe would be awesome, but we’re open to South america or maybe canada? We are in the US btw.
6. Ideally we would be staying somewhere quiet/peaceful with easy access to more bustling areas for day trips, or vice versa (stay in an interesting city with easy access to lots of surrounding nature).
We’re having a hard time coming up with a plan… resorts may be cool, but no cruises. Otherwise we’re open minded.

1j81am4,2025-03-10 15:30:09,Finding flights with the biggest % discount vs average price,hdnyc09,"I have a week free next week to travel. I don’t really care where I go, but would like to go somewhere international that I haven’t been to before. 

Is there a website or app that shows the flights with the biggest % discounts compared to average for the dates that I would like to travel? 

For example, if I’m free March 16-21, is there a way to check and see which flights would be the biggest deals vs their typical prices? And can you check this for both economy/business/first?

If a flight to Japan normally costs $2k, and I can fly for $1k, that would be 50% off. If a flight to Spain normally costs $1000, and I can fly for $700, that would be 30% off. So on this situation, I would choose to go to Japan since that is the biggest discount vs the typical average price. Even better is if they also showed the flights with the biggest discount for miles and dollars, so I can possibly use some credit card points.

1j6tqsn,2025-03-08 23:14:16,I just took my first big international vacation and it wasn’t what I expected it to be.,Matt8992,"I’ve been planning this trip to Switzerland for months. It was my first big trip out of North America. I’ve been up to Montreal for work and down to Cancun for a couple of days, but that’s it.  This 9 day trip to Switzerland was supposed to be magical. 

I was super excited to see another part of the world, experience a new culture, try new foods, and see the Swiss alps.

Even better, my 11 year old son was coming on the trip and my sister (in Ireland) was going to meet us there!

I budgeted the shit out of this trip and budgeted/planned so well that I actually ended the trip $975 under budget.

Well, the trip comes and it wasn’t what I expected.  My son was as grumpy most of the trip from being jet lagged. He didn’t want to walk anywhere and hated how busy our days were. I was trying to keep him happy and keep up with my sister’s energy (she’s used to traveling around Europe). But it was hard and I couldn’t enjoy all the magical views and places I imagined.

Day 6 comes and we’ve done almost everything on the itinerary. I walk into my son’s room that evening and he’s just crying in bed. Turns out he was really homesick and tired of being away from his mom and friends. He didn’t like the food, his allergies had been killing him, and he was just exhausted.

Of course, as a dad, this breaks my heart, but then sends me into panic/anxiety mode and I’m trying to figure out how to fix it. My idea? Cut the trip short by two days.

I propose the idea to my sister and she hates it. She goes to talk to my son to try to encourage him to push through but he wasn’t having it. He was done. So I cancel out last hotel (full refund) and change our flights at no cost.  My sister gets all her stuff figured out as well. (I paid for almost everything we did on the trip. Lodging, tours, transit, most food, etc). So I didn’t feel bad cutting the trip short. I even paid for the fee it cost to change her flight.

The morning we are to travel back to the US, I wake up sick with fatigue, sore throat, and a fever. We travel by train from interlaken to Zurich for two hours, wait 3 hrs for our flight, fly to Amsterdam after a 30 min delayed flight. Then we rush halfway across the airport to get on our flight to Atlanta and it’s delayed over and hour because of mechanical issues.  Then I sit on a plane for 9 hrs with an exhausted son and being sick myself. (I wore a mask, constantly used hand sanitizer, and informed the FAs who sat me and my son in an isolated part of the plane since it was mostly empty).

All-in-all, this magical trip I had been planning for months just wasn’t that great to be honest.  My son says he really liked the trip and so did my sister, but I just felt anxious and stressed the entire time.


Although my budget was great, we did most of the items on the itinerary, and saw beautiful views, I couldn’t enjoy it.

It really bummed me out and now I have no desire to travel anymore.  My son actually had been begging me to go to Japan this summer and I was going to take him, but in the flight home he asked me to cancel it. He doesn’t want to travel anymore this year.

Maybe I’ll want to travel one more time this year, but I think it’ll be by myself and for a shorter period of time and close to home. I love my son but I just don’t know if he is ready for such big trips.


Anyways, rants/thoughts over.



Edit: the main point of this story is that I put too much hope in this trip and idealized it.  My son did nothing wrong, we just didn’t know this trip would take such a toll on us.  For what it’s worth, I was super homesick as well and felt panicked about the fact I was so far from home and felt trapped.

Edit 2: the biggest issue for my son was his allergies. The Airbnb was dusty and the owner lived next door and had two dogs. On top of that, my sister has a cat back in Ireland and my son is very allergic to cats.  He stayed loaded up on all allergy meds and they made him tired. We did have a lot of down time and slept in, but his allergies really bothered him. I think it was mostly a mismatch between him and my sister unfortunately. Her cat dander on her clothes and such were really beating his allergies up.


Last edit: my son wanted to go on this trip just as much as me.  He looked up items he wanted to do, food he wanted to try and we planned it together.  We planned for jet lag (lazy day the first day) and we did one or two things a day once we realized how busy we’d be. We skipped a lot on the itinerary.  If I were to do things differently, I would have done all the mountain activities first and then stay in the city for the last two days.  I would have done a hotel or an Airbnb with no pets and I would have asked my sister to wash all her stuff thoroughly.  Overall, my son tells me he really liked the trip, he just had a hard time after a few days and such.  He loved the plane ride, train rides, playing in the park in Grindelwald, doing the chocolate making class, and getting to see his aunt for a few days.",648,1066,travel,"I just took my first big international vacation and it wasn’t what I expected it to be.

the city for the last two days  i would have done a hotel or an airbnb with no pets and i would have asked my sister to wash all her stuff thoroughly  overall my son tells me he really liked the trip he just had a hard time after a few days and such  he loved the plane ride train rides playing in the park in grindelwald doing the chocolate making class and getting to see his aunt for a few days","['took', 'first', 'big', 'international', 'vacation', 'wasnt', 'expected', 'ive', 'planning', 'trip', 'switzerland', 'month', 'first', 'big', 'trip', 'north', 'america', 'ive', 'montreal',

1j7dah7,2025-03-09 17:55:23,Thailand travel experience,Hangry-puppy-167,"I wanted to share a wonderful travel story with everyone. Things have been quite challenging lately and I hope this spreads a little positivity around.

Alright story time: I traveled to Phuket, Thailand just before the pandemic kicked off in 2020. I traveled with my then girlfriend (now wife). She had been there before and helped by putting together a wonderful itinerary for us. One of the days including a speedboat trip to a bunch of islands. We were going to be on the boat all day island hopping.

Morning of the trip I felt a little off, couldn’t figure out what was wrong but I shrugged it off and got into the boat. Throughout the day, I just felt worse and worse. I felt nauseous and couldn’t relax. I tried putting on a happy face for my partner, she was loving it up thankfully and enjoying herself.

By the time we got to the last leg, I was visibly a wreck. The entire boat was starring at me. I figured it must be seasickness. The captain of the boat even came down to try and soothe me. He brought a wet washcloth and was dabbing it on my face. 

Here’s the best part of the story. Everyone on the boat was Chinese and a little ok the older side. I don’t speak Chinese and neither does my partner, but we were having a great time with everyone.

This Chinese grandpa and grandma sat down next to me. This grandma was singing Chinese lullabies to me and the grandpa rubbed some ointment under my nose to help ease the seasickness and he gave me a huge pack of gum and chewed it with me and he just sat there holding me. 

I was very much a 32 year old corn fed American boy, but their love and compassion made me melt. 

They didn’t speak English, and I didn’t speak a word of a Chinese but we bonded so hard with each other. I think about those people all the time. I think this is the wonderful thing about human nature, people don’t like to see others suffer and it feels so good to help others in need; and to receive that care means even more. It’s the most beautiful and powerful thing about travel.

I hope you all can experience things like that on your adventures. 

PS: It was “Bangkok belly”, I threw up in the van on the way back to hotel. I was fine in 2 days. Shout out to my wonderful wife for bringing me sick food in the hotel after my stomach settled.

Here’s the best part of the story. Everyone on the boat was Chinese and a little ok the older side. I don’t speak Chinese and neither does my partner, but we were having a great time with everyone.

This Chinese grandpa and grandma sat down next to me. This grandma was singing Chinese lullabies to me and the grandpa rubbed some ointment under my nose to help ease the seasickness and he gave me a huge pack of gum and chewed it with me and he just sat there holding me. 

I was very much a 32 year old corn fed American boy, but their love and compassion made me melt. 

They didn’t speak English, and I didn’t speak a word of a Chinese but we bonded so hard with each other. I think about those people all the time. I think this is the wonderful thing about human nature, people don’t like to see others suffer and it feels so good to help others in need; and to receive that care means even more. It’s the most beautiful and powerful thing about travel.

I hope you all can experience things like that on your adventures. 

PS: It was “Bangkok belly”, I threw up in the van on the way back to hotel. I was fine in 2 days. Shout out to my wonderful wife for bringing me sick food in the hotel after my stomach settled.

I usually work in Dubai, but due to family reasons I had to leave the country. I am a German citizen living in Germany, and I have been managing my Dubai-based company from here. However, I need to head back to Dubai briefly because my UAE residence visa expires if I am out of the country for more than 180 days - and that deadline is coming up soon.

Here’s the rundown:

* **Flight Route:** Frankfurt (FRA) → Dubai → Frankfurt
* **Flight Details:** I land in Dubai at around 8:55 p.m. and catch my return flight at 5:50 a.m. the next day (roughly a 9-hour stay)
* **Luggage:** I plan to fly without any checked or hand luggage

My worry is that arriving without any luggage might draw extra attention at customs in Frankfurt, especially if I am among the first to exit the terminal. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would it be wiser to carry a small piece of hand luggage just to blend in?

Thanks in advance for any insights or shared experiences!

google maps says its only an hour  is this accurate i dont really see the downside here but im surprised that gold coast is cheaper as i thought that would be the more touristy spot is there anything else i need to consider besides the  hr drive","['landing', 'brisbane', 'v', 'gold', 'coast', 'airport', 'going', 'flying', 'brisbane', 'week', 'right', 'seems', 'flight', 'gold', 'coast', 'cheaper', 'there', 'u', 'add', 'maybe', 'like', 'cheaper', 'im', 'going', 'hire', 'car', 'whole', 'time', 'im', 'really', 'matter', 'airport', 'fly', 'im', 'thinking', 'fly', 'gold', 'coast', 'get', 'hire', 'car', 'drive', 'brisbane', 'leave', 'ill', 'drive', 'back', 'gold', 'coast', 'airport', 'google', 'map', 'say', 'hour', 'accurate', 'dont', 'really', 'see', 'downside', 'im', 'surprised', 'gold', 'coast', 'cheaper', 'thought', 'would', 'touristy', 'spot', 'anything', 'else', 'need', 'consider', 'besides', 'hr', 'drive']","['landing brisbane', 'brisbane v', 'v gold', 'gold coast', 'coast airport', 'airport going', 'going flying', 'flying brisbane', 'brisbane week', 'week right', 'right seems', 'seems flight', 'flight gold', 'gold coast', 'coast cheaper', 'cheaper there', 'there u', 'u add', 'add maybe', 'maybe like', 'like cheaper', 'cheaper im', 'im going', 'going hire', 'hire car', 'car whole', 'whole time', 'time im', 'im really', 'really matter', 'matter airport', 'airport fly', 'fly im', 'im thinking', 'thinking fly', 'fly gold', 'gold coast', 'coast get', 'get hire', 'hire car', 'car drive', 'drive brisbane', 'brisbane leave', 'leave ill', 'ill drive', 'drive back', 'back gold', 'gold coast', 'coast airport', 'airport google', 'google map', 'map say', 'say hour', 'hour accurate', 'accurate dont', 'dont really', 'really see', 'see downside', 'downside im', 'im surprised', 'surprised gold', 'gold coast', 'coast cheaper', 'cheaper thought', 'thought would', 'would touristy', 'touristy spot', 'spot anything', 'anything else', 'else need', 'need consider', 'consider besides', 'besides hr', 'hr drive']","['landing brisbane v', 'brisbane v gold', 'v gold coast', 'gold coast airport', 'coast airport going', 'airport going flying', 'going flying brisbane', 'flying brisbane week', 'brisbane week right', 'week right seems', 'right seems flight', 'seems flight gold', 'flight gold coast', 'gold coast cheaper', 'coast cheaper there', 'cheaper there u', 'there u add', 'u add maybe', 'add maybe like', 'maybe like cheaper', 'like cheaper im', 'cheaper im going', 'im going hire', 'going hire car', 'hire car whole', 'car whole time', 'whole time im', 'time im really', 'im really matter', 'really matter airport', 'matter airport fly', 'airport fly im', 'fly im thinking', 'im thinking fly', 'thinking fly gold', 'fly gold coast', 'gold coast get', 'coast get hire', 'get hire car', 'hire car drive', 'car drive brisbane', 'drive brisbane leave', 'brisbane leave ill', 'leave ill drive', 'ill drive back', 'drive back gold', 'back gold coast', 'gold coast airport', 'coast airport google', 'airport google map', 'google map say', 'map say hour', 'say hour accurate', 'hour accurate dont', 'accurate dont really', 'dont really see', 'really see downside', 'see downside im', 'downside im surprised', 'im surprised gold', 'surprised gold coast', 'gold coast cheaper', 'coast cheaper thought', 'cheaper thought would', 'thought would touristy', 'would touristy spot', 'touristy spot anything', 'spot anything else', 'anything else need', 'else need consider', 'need consider besides', 'consider besides hr', 'besides hr drive']"

All a property has to do is to charge you using a merchant number not matching what they provided to Booking.com, and you are done! I am currently out $4,401 thanks to them! 

I had booked an apartment for a month in Mexico. Free cancellation until the day before. With permission, the apt manager accessed my CC on Booking.com's site to take payment a week prior to my arrival. I was overcharged by almost $100. I had receipts from them and my credit card to prove it. I told Booking.com and the property to please refund the money. The response from the apt mgr was to tell me that I was no longer welcome and that they were cancelling my reservation. (All posted on Whatsapp.) 
At that point I did not trust the apt mgr, and was still in the free cancellation window, so I cancelled myself. Have confirmation of successful cancel, as well as confirmation of another booking in the same town for the same dates. Can prove I stayed at the other place through transport records on Booking.com as well as the mgr of the place I actually stayed. 

Never refunded from property. 

Got assurances from a Booking.com supervisor that I needed only to send them a copy of my CC statement showing lack of reimbursement from the property, and then if Booking.com couldn't get them to pay in 5 business days, it is the policy of Booking.com to reimburse us for the funds themselves. Got a confirmation email that they received what they needed and was told to call back in 5 business day to request the refund if I had not yet gotten it. 

Six business days later I called. Booking.com's finance department said they could not reimburse me because the property owner's merchant number did not match what they had on record, so they ""couldn't"" reimburse me, despite having receipts I sent them from the property that matched my CC statement, and despite the fact that they allowed the property to access my CC from their site!

Emailed the CEO, CFO, and customer service for Booking.com with a complete history, made it clear that they were allowing their customer to be defrauded, and let them know that I had the time and energy to tell the world what they did. Not one response.

Disputed the charges on my CC. On a level 2 dispute right now. Merchant claimed first the charges were legit. Chase went back to them again.

1j7harx,2025-03-09 20:49:09,"Backpacking Kerala, India",Foksn,"Hi,

To preface this question, I'd like to start out by saying sorry if my preconceived notions may offend someone, I nor my girlfriend has ever been anywhere in India. Therefor my preconceived notions are based on hearsay.

We are a couple from Sweden, planning a backpacking trip in December and Kerala caught our eyes. We can get maybe 13 days off work in total, meaning a 2,5 week long trip. We are in our early/mid thirties. We are looking for an affordable destination, not too far away. As far as I understand, Kerala differs some from the rest of India in terms of being more tranquil. I remember that it got voted as one of the best destinations in some Swedish travel magazine a couple of years ago.

  
Does it differ a lot from the rest of the country? We are not interested to visit the India that is portrayed as a dirty hell hole (I'm sure it's not in real life). We are not interested in mega cities or stomach bugs. But Kerala seems kinda amazing. It seems to fit our wants and needs, having beaches, trekking opportunities, great culture and good food. 

  
Our style of travel is backpacking/flashpacking, preferring to stay in hostels in a private room but having the option to hang out and socialize with other people, grabbing drinks and food together and going on excursions in a group with friends. Is this a thing here? We want that small, beachy town vibe. We'd like to immerse ourselves in the culture, go for hikes, have good food (not Micheline, but good street food).

  
I've been looking around for some kind of itinerary but they seems to be kinda scarce.  Is this feasible, is there a ""backpacker scene"" in Kerala? Would two weeks suffice?

1j7ri47,2025-03-10 05:26:24,Avianca flight via Capital One travel - misleading cost of carry on bag?,mrtristateareawide,"UPDATE: As a precaution to future travelers, as of writing this there is apparently no way for me to use avianca's online website to book carry on, only check in (for basic fare). I had to call them directly, and give credit card info. ALSO, the website calculator is apparently incorrect! The agent told me it was $60 and when I asked for the reasoning for the discrepancy, she said that they reserved the right to change prices... I guess only $10 difference but still feels shady.



Hey folks, inexperienced traveler here. I booked an Avianca flight from NYC to Cusco, Peru, \*next week\* (so more than 48 hours from my purchase to the flight date) with the expectation that, according to their calculator [https://ayuda.avianca.com/hc/en-us/p/calculadora-equipaje](https://ayuda.avianca.com/hc/en-us/p/calculadora-equipaje), should be $50

https://preview.redd.it/vy3e42i7ysne1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6fb368b7b2087b77f79ff80a18cb59b4ee1c91

I booked the flight via Capital One Travel portal. I just got an email with flight confirmation, and in the pdf this part worries me, because I think it's saying it costs $125

https://preview.redd.it/shj82t9ursne1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d4e10ea1b784f2175a95364e8f45f3e85e3fb8

This is significantly more than what I was expecting to pay. While it won't be the end of the world I feel like I got $75 scammed by I don't even know who (the airline or capital one).

Did I misunderstand the calculator? Or (hopefully) I'm misunderstanding the pdf confirmation? Do these things just happen if I book via 3rd party? I also tried calling Avianca, they sent me a bot to conversate with on whatsapp but I didn't get my question answered.

Thanks

Australia is very far away from everything, but I was wondering if we needed to stop by our home between the two continents, just to switch over our travel gear? It would be a long trek back and forth.

Any other solutions? Or should we just haul all our heavy luggage with us - woukd be challenging, as we are planning on moving between many different locations quite quickly!

My wife, who had stayed in SA longer was travelling home today via the same route, and had drank all her water before getting to security, had the bottle confiscated. Same type of plastic bottle as mine.

On a previous journey, I was told not to take electronics out of my bag, only to have to do it for the return journey through the same airport.

I’ve also had staff threaten to confiscate an electric shaver before even though their own signs have them on the “allowed” list.

A: highway 1 has a major closure and no one seems to know when it will reopen?

B: Every campsite in Yosemite is already booked out for the summer. More open 2 weeks in advance but that seems like a big gamble for my type A soul 

I'm amenable to replacing either of those things with Sequoia, which seems a bit quieter than either of them if that seems like a good idea (or a good last minute contingency if the road is closed or I can't get a campsite in yosemite 2 weeks out?)

The major things on my hit list are highway 1 and yosemite, however I'm starting to freak out about of those things. 

A: highway 1 has a major closure and no one seems to know when it will reopen?

B: Every campsite in Yosemite is already booked out for the summer. More open 2 weeks in advance but that seems like a big gamble for my type A soul 

I'm amenable to replacing either of those things with Sequoia, which seems a bit quieter than either of them if that seems like a good idea (or a good last minute contingency if the road is closed or I can't get a campsite in yosemite 2 weeks out?)

I would love anyone's thoughts and opinions on this, this would be my first time to CA so I'm rather nervous.

Option 2 - flying into Singapore, flying to Vietnam and travelling either up or down and then flying to the north of Thailand and travelling south. Obviously we will have a lot of luggage with us so pros of the first option is less flying but i’ve done more research into Vietnam and am keen to explore one day, whereas, i know less about Malaysia.

They're not the type to solely sit on a beach all day, every day so the destination has to have a mix of both relaxation & activities, tours, etc. Bonus points if there's a boat tour or motorcycle rental available.

I'd really love to make sure that all costs are covered for them outside of anything they want to spend on their own (all-inclusive preferred or at least one meal covered and I'd give them money to make up for the difference).

I’m travelling with my extended family to El Salvador next week for 2 weeks with twin 4 yos, 1 yo, 10 yo and 14 yo.. looking for: 
- fun activities to do with a big crew of kids (we will mostly be staying on the beach and taking it easy but a few family friendly activities would be nice) volcano or jungle adventures? Museums? 
- any safety advice.. I’m particularly curious about water/food safety and if people eat ice when out at restaurants, food safety, eating fresh veg/fruit, etc. I’m a well seasoned traveller so more worried about the kids 
- any other general advice? 

Thanks :)

1gdm2qo,2024-10-27 21:42:39,Trip report - Rapa Nui (Easter Island),CrushableStetson,"Easter Island (Rapa Nui) trip report

I'm posting this as I often use reddit for travel research and feel I should give back. The shirt version though is that it is Rapa Nui is definitely worth it IMO.

Key details
- 6 days, 5 nights
- Couple - one waiting 20 years to go and another just happy to be there. 
- total cost incl flights, tours, park tickets, food accommodation & airprot taxis to and from Santiago airport - $1,658 or $829 pp.
- Flights $652 return for both $326 each booked two months before departure. 

Planning/research
Mostly reddit trip reports, guide geek GPT, and reviews online

Tour Company
Hahave tours - 2/5 stars would suggest you take a risk with another company or at least book some with another company. 

Pros: budget friendly, all tours took place and most, though not all, of the staff are nice.

Cons: very poor on communication and details. 

We asked for an outline of tours several times but did not get it. This had a materially negative impact on several yours. E.g. did not inform us that one tour ended with a two hour beach stop, which led to us waiting to go for 2 hours to go home rather than enjoying the beach as we didn't have towels/shorts etc. It's still nice but could have been much better. 

Did not offer information on what to bring, etc. 

Told us to be outside for 05.40 to be collected for sunrise. Did not arrive until 06.25, no apology or acknowledgement of lateness, and did not provide us with information until we sought it from them when they were 20 minutes late. 

Overall, I would not recommend it to a friend. 

5 tours we did were:

1. Show artistic ballet - enjoyable but ultimately unnecessary. They didn't explain what it was, and it kinda felt like a tourist trap experience, though their may have been more to it.  2/5
2. Full day Hopu Manu - the guide was hard to understand, which made the tour difficult to follow. 3/5
3. Amanacer ahu tongariki(sunrise) - this was cool, but our experience in the lead up kinda burned it a bit 3/5
4. Full day Moai Henua - aamzing. Same guide as for Tour 2 but had visual aids and was way way better. 5/5 highlight of the trip.
5. Trekking cavernas - cool but poorly explained, probably not needed. 3/5. 

I had been waiting years to come here and often found myself filling in details for my partner, but honestly, it was tough to follow even if you sometimes knew what was coming. 

Accommodation
Pua Vaenga (Would recommend) - $247.50 for 5 nights. Private room shared bathroom. Collected at and dropped off to the airport included. 
 
Pros: cheap, excellent staff, good facilities. Nice atmosphere. Family owned, and they are very nice. Nice common area.

Cons: not the cleanest and a 30-minute walk from town. But it's still worth it.

Food
Combination of grocery shopping and restaurants. I found the food in restaurants very good. Groceries were more expensive than the mainland but mostly okay. We could not find chicken in stores, though. 

The tap water tastes very odd. Only place I've been where I couldn't drink it. Bottled and filtered water everywhere, though, so it's not an issue (though bottled water is expensive) 

Was pleasantly surprised by the wine selection (I know Chile is wine country. I just didn't expect it to make it that far). 

Overall

It's an incredible place, and despite the tour company, just being there really carries. You feel so tiny surrounded by water with no other population for 2000 km. And the the history and heads are just enthralling. It's absolutely worth it, but you could do it for less money and in a shorter time frame.

If you are stuck, you could very much get away with tours 2 and 4 above and still feel like you did what needed to be done. That being said, I am definitely glad we stayed longer and took it slower.",11,12,travel,"Trip report - Rapa Nui (Easter Island) Easter Island (Rapa Nui) trip report

1exobto,2024-08-21 12:28:26,El Salvador Travel Advice ,StageRight2023,"El Salvador Three Day Plan - Need some advice 

Hey everyone, 

Wanted to get some advice/tips for an upcoming trip I have to El Salvador. Wanted to ask what would be the best schedule with the limited amount of time. 

Coming in late November 2024, for a total of 5 days (3 whole days) and 2 travel days. It’s me and my friends (both male), not really into the party scene and want to have a more adventure type trip. We don’t speak Spanish (although don’t think this would be a big problem for a few days) and we aren’t super interested in buildings/history/churches just due to the limited time we have. 

I also want to make this a budget friendly trip, any suggestions to maximize our money spent would be appreciated ! 

I’m having some trouble deciding what’s the best location to stay. Not sure if we should stay in San Salvador or El Tunco or Santa Ana. From what I’ve gathered reading some stuff on Reddit that it’s best to stay in El Tunco or Santa Ana for a few days given we want to be close to adventure. I’d say based on our interests we’d want to stay in El Tunco and drive to places around the vicinity.  Alternatively, this plan could work with Santa Ana as a base point as well with some modifications.

Wondering if anyone has anything to add to this: 

Day 1- Fly into San Salvador at around 9 PM, take a rental car from the airport and go to El Tunco the same day.  Hoping to see if this is a smart idea/safe to do? 

Day 2- Drive to Santa Ana Volcano and do the hike (hoping to see if anyone I could help with this and if we could get a guide early morning (I’ve heard they stop guides after 11 AM)). After this, visit the hot waterfalls in the Santa Ana area (Malacatiupan falls). After this, head to the BNB in El Tunco and relax. 

Day 3: Surf lesson at the beach, chill and explore the area. Perhaps go and do the Tamanique waterfalls mid day for the hike (would appreciate if anyone can comment on how to get a guide for this day). Close out the day relaxing by the beach/watching the sunset. 

Day 4: ***This day is up to debate ***

Start off the day at Atami Escape Resorts and stay there for a few hours and just hang out and enjoy the morning. Evening is probably up to debate but likely head back to San Salvador and check out the city (if it’s worth it, if there’s anything interesting left in El Tunco please comment below). 

Day 5: Early morning flight back home, stay in proximity of airport and check back the rental car.

I have always wanted to go to Ireland and Scotland but just want to choose one to focus on for next summer. I know this question has been asked a bunch, but not sure what we should choose first based on our wants. We’re a couple in our late 20s. 

- 2 weeks 
- We love history and love learning about things from long long ago. The older the better! 
- We want to see castles and have the opportunity to explore the inside as well. 
- We love fantasy and want to see some beautiful landscapes! Love LoTR and GoT so any scenery that has that vibe to it would be fun to experience. 
- My partner wants to eat some good food. I have Celiac Disease so hoping to go to places that can accommodate that. 
- We like to hike but no more than 7 miles round trip. Love nature and animals. 
- Want to go to pubs at some point and meet people and drink and have a good time! 
- Comfortable renting a car and driving distances, but do not want the trip to be primarily driving. 
- Also wanting to relax. Don’t want to constantly be on the go. 

Thank you in advance! :)

18zysur,2024-01-06 12:16:37,Our Trip to Spain and Cote d'azur,Rich-Pop-1081,"Indian in mid-30s here. I just completed a 2 week Euro trip with my wife and had tons of support from past posts in this subreddit. I decided to return the favour, and would try to document things in as much detail as possible below:   


We did this trip in the last 2 weeks in December – spent 4 days in Spain, 5 days in the French Riviera and last 4 days in Paris.  


**Trip Cost Breakdown:**

|Title|Spent (in INR)|(Eqv. USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Attraction and Tickets|\~30,000 |360|
|Local Commuting|\~46,000 |550|
|Flights |\~134,000 |1600|
|Food |\~36,000 |430|
|Insurance|\~2000 |24|
|Mobile SIMs|\~2000 |24|
|Stays|\~67000 |800|
|Souvenir|\~3600 |40|
|Miscellaneous|\~6000 |72|

In addition, we also used few Accor points for our stay in Paris and for transport to and from the airport:

|Title|Points|Equivalent (INR/USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|4 day stay in Paris  (IBIS)|\~18000|INR 33000 / 400 USD|
|Cab from CDG Airport to IBIS|\~3200|INR 2880 / 35 USD|

**Total Trip cost: \~** **INR 3,67,000 ( 4,400 USD)**  
(inclusive of points eqv. worth of money)  


* **Spain**: We made Castelldefels our base in Spain. A very quiet and nice town. Our Airbnb was a 200m walk, and 20 mins to Barcelona. It also helped that it falls in Zone 1, which allowed us to use our T-Casual for all the travel.    
(For those considering Sitges – it falls in a different zone, and you will not be able to use your T-casual to travel to Barcelona. Instead make Castelldefels your base and Sitges is 15 mins ride from there)  
We visited *Barcelona*, *Girona*, *Montserrat* and *Sitges*, and loved all of them!
* **French Riviera:** We had Nice as our base here. This was a much more relaxed leg of the trip. We stuck to buying individual tickets due to lack of a proper pass.   
\[If you want to add a data point to your trip, Italy is 30 mins ride from Nice :) \]  
We visited *Antibes*, *Eze*, *Ventimiglia* and *Sanremo.* All were brillant, but Eze was the highlight - absoutely magical!  

* **Paris:** We stayed in an IBIS in La Defense, very quiet and sparsely populated (atleast on streets). Given a choice, I would have stayed closer to the centre, as the Metro was about a mile away and it took 30 mins to get to city.   
We took individual tickets, which came down to be much lower than the 30 euro pp pass that's there. Paris was surprisingly the least well connected with public transport among all the places we visited before. Getting anywhere took a couple of metro changes, and airport travel was so complicated that we simply decided to book cabs.

Almost everywhere we went, Christmas markets were the highlights. Spain was the least buzzy and Paris was probably the best.  


**Managing Food:**  


* **Spain and French Riviera:** We are both vegetarians who eat egg, and had consciously taken Airbnbs in both Spain and French Riviera, so that we could manage meals a little more easily. We were cooking our breakfast in the morning, and eating our lunch and coffee outside. For dinner, we were either cooking a 1 pot meal with rice, or eating the meals we had brought along from India. (Theplas are a saviour my Indian friends!)
* **Paris:** We were staying in an IBIS, so no option of cooking. Our breakfast was included in the stay and we were having both meals outside. On a couple of days, we ordered in via Ubereats.  


**Learnings:**

* **Paying for entry tickets for all attractions isn't worth it.** We realised it mid-trip and didn't splurge in Paris at all. The view from the top is going to be similar from most places, and its completely okay to skip the tickets. Pick and choose well.
* **Museums are time, money and energy suckers.** There are way too many museums in Paris (and Europe in general), and be very clear on the ones you want to visit.  Find 1-2 that you really want to visit, and dedicate good time to them. (We are glad we paid for the Louvre!)
* **Food as a vegetarian is not straightforward.** Esp. as an Indian, you will have challenges if you are looking for food similar to back home. (And no, eating at Indian restaurants is not a great solution. They taste below average, cost high and are 99% times not run by Indians – likely a Pakistani or Bangladeshi and mostly will have non-veg food) Pack well and be okay to eat whatever is available locally.
* **Do your math around tickets.** For eg. in Spain we were glad we took the T-Casual. It served us for the entire trip of 4 days. In Nice and Paris, we were better off buying individual tickets. 
* **Be mindful of train platforms.** We boarded the train going the wrong side at least twice :D It could be just us, but never hurts to stop and stare to check if you're on the correct platform. (Happened to us both times at small stations where the platform was on the other end of the entry side.)
* **Be ready to walk.** We were easily clocking 15k daily. Europe is beautiful, but you do need to walk and that can sometimes be uphill too. If you have elderly parents, consider this point seriously before bringing them along. 
* **1 person = 1 dish.** This was quite the unsaid norm across the places we visited. Some of them will be surprised if you order just 1 dish, but take it anyway, while some will outright reject. Some also levy a ""sharing charge"" separately in their Menu should you decide to order less and share. (Frankly the European appetite was a revelation for me. I and my wife struggled with 1 pizza genuinely, and I saw an 80 yr old lady easily devouring 1 and then washing it off with another coffee.)
* **Double check your food order.** I asked for a veg wrap at CDG Mcdonalds, and they still gave me chicken. English and vegetarian as a concept – both are not very well understood.
* **Walking tours are amazing.** If you are really looking forward to a place/museum/sightseeing, I'd highly recommend getting a walking tour. We took a free walking tour (with 20 euros tip) in Girona, and that was the highlight of the trip! Walking tours really help you know a place and bring it to life.
* **Stay put in 1 place for sometime, dont keep changing your base.** Unpacking and packing and moving from place to place can get tiring. We were conscious about this, still ended up feeling a bit exhausted by the time we were in Paris.   


Hope this helps. Will be very happy to add more details to this post or share specific information in the threads!

1jcr5fv,2025-03-16 17:47:56,Want to Travel & Work Abroad After Uni—What Are the Best Budget-Friendly Programmes?,chungus2100,"Hey hey, I would like to ask for some recommendations (also if you can suggest any other sub-reddits I could post this to, pls lmk). I will be graduating university in the coming months and from August/ September this year, I would like to dedicate around 2-3 years towards travel, volunteering and other pursuits that I would have trouble committing to on top of a graduate job and the responsibilities that come with paying for my own place. I am a permanent resident in the UK and I have an EU passport (no UK passport). I am also a young woman so I am looking for opportunities with some degree of background check such as an organisation etc. I am not interested in organising things entirely on my own (such as through contacting strangers offering volunteering opportunities on Facebook) out of concern for my safety unless in the context of travelling or backpacking out of my own pocket which I will absolutely sort out myself. I already have a few opportunities in mind which I will list below and I would really appreciate it if you could add to this list with any worthwhile opportunities I might not have heard of. I am open to volunteering or paid work as well as funded masters study opportunities all outside of the UK. I have worked throughout my entire undergrad to be able to fund my post-graduate adventures but I am still needing to watch my budget closely and I wouldn't be able to justify spending 500 euros + for a short term volunteering opportunity. The options I am interested in are those where accommodation and some food is also provided in exchange for my paid or unpaid labour. I am especially excited about the idea of teaching English abroad and have been looking into TEFL qualifications, however, I am open to any labour whether this be farm work, hospitality, cleaning, admin work etc. 

The following are opportunities I am already pursuing/ have applied for or are things I am keeping in mind and may do in the future: 

\- Erasmus Mundus with scholarship (International Masters) 

\- EU Solidarity Corps volunteering 

\- Workaway/ Worldpackers 

\-WWOOFing 

\- Temporary working visa in Australia, New Zealand, Canada 

\- Backpacking 

\-Teaching English in Spain through the British Council 

(Please note I will have graduated by the time I will begin so the opportunity cannot demand student status)

I’ve lived in bitola with an ex partner for half of last year and can speak the basics, I’ve decided it’s a country I’d want to move to as I loved the country that much.

I loved the way of life, the culture, the people in general and how much less controlled they are in comparison to Australia which makes living here tad more depressing. I found myself more happily imbedded in their general way of living and society which is something I’ve never been able to do in Australia. I’ve been to surrounding countries as well, but given I mostly know to speak Macedonian as opposed to any other language aside English, and know the basics of the country and town of Bitola itself and love the village feel to it which makes it my top pick.

I haven’t yet gone for my visa but do eventually plan on getting it when I’m prepared to move.

1j8aqck,2025-03-10 22:00:38,Brazil itinerary question,IsraeliGigaChad,"Hey, I'm currently staying in Brazil in buzios area after doing carnaval in Rio. 
On one hand I want to explore the north side of brazil, especially Lencois Marenhenses, Salvador and the Bahia coast but I'm thinking on giving up that area and just focusing on the north.
But flights look pretty expensive in the coming days to Sao Luis from Rio. 
Considering I plan to go to Ushaia just after I'm finished with Brazil I will pass through the south of brazil anyways as I also want to visit Iguaczu crossing the border there and florianopolis along with the Pantanal before that (recommendations would be welcome btw).

So I'm in a dilemma whether to go to the south now and come back to the north of brazil later in my trip from another neighbor country like Bolivia or Peru after I visit them, or go now to the north and then go to Argentina. 
What do you guys think ?

Malaga: 2 days 
Granada: 3 days (flying back to Barcelona on day 2)

We were thinking of stopping in nerja between malaga and Granada but would it be too much travelling? If anyone has any trips on travelling with a toddler please do share!!
