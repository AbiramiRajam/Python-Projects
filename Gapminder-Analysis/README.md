## Analysis of GNI per Capita, Population, and Life Expectancy (2001-2030) - Canada & United States

This project investigates the intricate relationships between Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, population size, and life expectancy in **Canada** and the **United States** using data from the Gapminder datasets spanning from 2001 to 2030. By examining these indicators over time, the study aims to identify significant trends and correlations between economic factors, population projections, and life expectancy outcomes in these two North American nations.

**Datasources:**

* Life Expectancy (Gapminder)
* Population (Gapminder)
* GNI Per Capita (Gapminder)

**Years of Analysis:** 2001 to 2030

**Countries Included:** Canada, United States

### Correlation Analysis

The correlation matrix derived from the data reveals the following key relationships:

* **Population and GNI per Capita (GDP):** A **positive correlation** suggests that, within this dataset, the country with a larger population (United States) tends to have a higher overall GNI per capita. This likely reflects the larger economic output and market size associated with a greater population.

* **Population and Life Expectancy:** A **negative correlation** was observed, indicating that the country with the larger population (United States) tends to have a lower life expectancy compared to the country with a smaller population (Canada). This could be attributed to factors such as disparities in healthcare access, regional variations in living conditions, and other population-related challenges within the larger nation.

* **GNI per Capita and Life Expectancy:** A **negative correlation** was also identified. Despite having a higher GNI per capita, the United States does not exhibit a higher life expectancy than Canada. This suggests that higher economic wealth, in this specific comparison, does not automatically translate to longer life expectancy and may be influenced by other factors.

### Correlation and Analysis: Canada vs. United States (Based on Gapminder Dataset)

The analysis of Life Expectancy versus GNI per Capita between Canada and the United States highlights the following key observations:

* **Life Expectancy:** **Canada** demonstrates a **higher life expectancy** compared to the United States within the analyzed timeframe. This advantage can be potentially linked to Canada's robust healthcare system, emphasis on quality of life, and public health policies that contribute to increased longevity.

* **GNI per Capita and Population:** The **United States** leads in terms of **GNI per Capita** and possesses a **significantly larger population** than Canada. This reflects the substantial economic power of the U.S., driven by its diverse industries, technological innovation, and global economic influence.

* **Divergence:** Notably, despite its higher GNI per Capita and larger population, the **United States does not exhibit the same level of life expectancy as Canada**. This crucial finding suggests that economic prosperity alone is not a guarantee of longer life expectancy and that other factors, such as healthcare access, social safety nets, and lifestyle-related factors, play a significant role.

### Conclusion

These correlations and the comparative analysis between Canada and the United States underscore the complex interplay between economic factors, population size, and life expectancy. While a larger population may correlate with a higher overall GNI per capita, it does not necessarily translate to higher life expectancy. Furthermore, the case of Canada having a higher life expectancy despite a lower GNI per capita (compared to the US) emphasizes that factors beyond purely economic indicators, such as healthcare systems and quality of life, are critical determinants of life expectancy. Further research should delve deeper into the specific mechanisms and policy differences that contribute to these observed disparities between the two nations.
